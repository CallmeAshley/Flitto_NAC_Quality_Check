[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Russian uses continental European formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.
- A **space** is used every three digits in the integer part as a grouping separator.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56  
- 123 456 789,00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a space for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a comma for decimal points.
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal point.
- Do not use dots or irregular spacing as separators.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the Russian ruble (₽), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Russian conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
₽, $, €, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾  

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
RUB, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CNY, KRW, INR, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 долларов`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes such as `RUB`, `USD`, `EUR` are written **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56 RUB  
- 850,00 USD  
- 10 000,00 EUR  
- 300,00 GBP

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- A space must be used between number and code.
- Codes must be uppercase.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for the number.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “рубль”, “доллар”, “иена” are placed **after the number**, separated by a space.  
The form may change depending on the number due to Russian grammar (declension).

Examples:  
- 1 000 рублей  
- 850 долларов  
- 10 000 иен  
- 500 евро  
- 1 200 вон  
- 300 фунтов  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must follow the number, with a space.
- Ensure the correct grammatical form of the currency name is used.
- Do not generate a name unless it exists in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Russian dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it is placed **before the date** and separated by a comma.  
The letter `г.` (short for “год”, year) often follows the year in formal formats.  
Dots (`.`) are used in short formats.

Examples:  
- понедельник, 28 июля 2025 г.  
- 28 июля 2025 г.  
- 28.07.2025  
- 28.07.25

Evaluation Criteria:
- Confirm date order is Day → Month → Year.
- If weekday is present, it must precede the date and be followed by a comma.
- Accept both long-form and dotted short formats.
- `г.` should be used when included in the original.
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Russian uses the **24-hour clock**.  
Colons (`:`) are used to separate hours, minutes, and seconds.  
AM/PM is not used.  
Time zones (e.g., московское стандартное время, MSK) are only included when explicitly stated.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM markers.
- Include time zones only if present in the original.
