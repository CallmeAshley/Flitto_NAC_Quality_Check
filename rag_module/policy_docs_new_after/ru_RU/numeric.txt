[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Russian uses continental European formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.
- A **space** is used every three digits in the integer part as a grouping separator.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56  
- 123 456 789,00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a space for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a comma for decimal points.
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal point.
- Do not use dots or irregular spacing as separators.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
