[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the Russian ruble (₽), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Russian conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
₽, $, €, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾  

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
RUB, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CNY, KRW, INR, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 долларов`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as `₽` appear **after the number**, with a **space** in between.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56 ₽  
- 850,00 $  
- 10 000,00 €  
- 300,00 £  
- 1 200,00 ¥

Evaluation Criteria:
- The symbol must follow the number.
- A space must be present before the symbol.
- Numeric formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] section.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes such as `RUB`, `USD`, `EUR` are written **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56 RUB  
- 850,00 USD  
- 10 000,00 EUR  
- 300,00 GBP

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- A space must be used between number and code.
- Codes must be uppercase.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for the number.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “рубль”, “доллар”, “иена” are placed **after the number**, separated by a space.  
The form may change depending on the number due to Russian grammar (declension).

Examples:  
- 1 000 рублей  
- 850 долларов  
- 10 000 иен  
- 500 евро  
- 1 200 вон  
- 300 фунтов  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must follow the number, with a space.
- Ensure the correct grammatical form of the currency name is used.
- Do not generate a name unless it exists in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
