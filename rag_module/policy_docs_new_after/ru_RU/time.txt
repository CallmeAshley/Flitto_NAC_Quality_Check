If the translated sentence uses a colloquial or emotionally expressive tone (e.g., social media style, casual speech), do not forcibly replace natural time expressions like 'between 1 and 2 AM' with strict [Time Format] such as '01:00 and 02:00', unless clarity is compromised.

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Russian uses the **24-hour clock**.  
Colons (`:`) are used to separate hours, minutes, and seconds.  
AM/PM is not used.  
Time zones (e.g., московское стандартное время, MSK) are only included when explicitly stated.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM markers.
- Include time zones only if present in the original.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
