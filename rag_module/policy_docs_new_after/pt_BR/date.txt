[Date Format]

Definition:  
Portuguese dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it must appear **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
The “de” preposition is used between day, month, and year in long formats.  
Slashes (`/`) are used in numeric formats.

Examples:  
- segunda-feira, 28 de julho de 2025  
- 28 de julho de 2025  
- 28/07/2025  
- 28/07/25  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Confirm date order is Day → Month → Year.
- If weekday is present, it appears before the date and is followed by a comma.
- Accept both prepositional long forms and numeric short forms.
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
