[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Portuguese follows continental European numeric formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a dot for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a comma for decimal points.
- No grouping after the decimal.
- Do not insert spaces between digits and separators.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Portuguese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dólares`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., €) appears **before the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- € 1.234,56  
- $ 850,00  
- ¥ 10.000,00  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must appear before the number.
- Use a space between the symbol and the number.
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD) are also written **before the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- EUR 1.234,56  
- USD 2.000,00  
- JPY 10.000,00  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must precede the number.
- A space must separate code and number.
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.
- Codes must use uppercase letters (e.g., USD, EUR).

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euro”, “dólar”, or “iene” appear **after the number**, with a space.  
Currency names are written in lowercase.

Examples:  
- 1.000 euros  
- 850 dólares  
- 10.000 ienes  
- 500 libras  
- 1.200 wons  
- 300 yuans  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency names must follow the number with a space.
- Names should be lowercase and follow Portuguese spelling conventions.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.
- Do not generate currency names unless they appear in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Portuguese dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it must appear **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
The “de” preposition is used between day, month, and year in long formats.  
Slashes (`/`) are used in numeric formats.

Examples:  
- segunda-feira, 28 de julho de 2025  
- 28 de julho de 2025  
- 28/07/2025  
- 28/07/25  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Confirm date order is Day → Month → Year.
- If weekday is present, it appears before the date and is followed by a comma.
- Accept both prepositional long forms and numeric short forms.
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Portuguese uses the **24-hour clock**, with colons (`:`) separating time units.  
Time zone names (e.g., “horário de verão da Europa Ocidental”) should not be included unless explicitly stated.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons between hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Do not use AM/PM markers.
- Include time zones only if present in the original.
