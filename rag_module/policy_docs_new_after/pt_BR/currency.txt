[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Portuguese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dólares`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., €) appears **before the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- € 1.234,56  
- $ 850,00  
- ¥ 10.000,00  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must appear before the number.
- Use a space between the symbol and the number.
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD) are also written **before the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- EUR 1.234,56  
- USD 2.000,00  
- JPY 10.000,00  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must precede the number.
- A space must separate code and number.
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.
- Codes must use uppercase letters (e.g., USD, EUR).

---

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euro”, “dólar”, or “iene” appear **after the number**, with a space.  
Currency names are written in lowercase.

Examples:  
- 1.000 euros  
- 850 dólares  
- 10.000 ienes  
- 500 libras  
- 1.200 wons  
- 300 yuans  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency names must follow the number with a space.
- Names should be lowercase and follow Portuguese spelling conventions.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.
- Do not generate currency names unless they appear in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
