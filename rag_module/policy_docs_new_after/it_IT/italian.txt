[Locale: it-IT]

[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Italian uses continental European formatting:  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.  
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00  
- 5,00  
- 12.000  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use dots for digit grouping in the integer part.  
- Use commas for decimal points.  
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal point.  
- No space should appear between digits and punctuation.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Italian conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, CNY, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dollari`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 EUR  
- 2.000,00 USD  
- 800,00 JPY  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Code must appear after the number.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names like “euro”, “dollaro”, or “yen” appear **after the number**, usually with a space.  
All currency names in Italian are written in lowercase.

Examples:  
- 1.000 euro  
- 850 dollari  
- 10.000 yen  
- 500 sterline  
- 300 rubli  
- 1.200 won  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency name must appear after the number with a space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency in Italian.  
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless one exists in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Italian dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is included, it must appear **before the date**, without a comma.  
Slashes (`/`) are used in short format.

Examples:  
- lunedì 28 luglio 2025  
- 28 luglio 2025  
- 28 lug 2025  
- 28/07/25  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Ensure the order is Day → Month → Year.  
- If a weekday is present, place it before the date with no comma.  
- Accept both full and abbreviated month names.  
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it is explicitly present in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Italian uses the **24-hour clock** format.  
Colons (`:`) separate hours, minutes, and seconds.  
AM/PM is not used.  
Time zone names (e.g., CET, CEST) are not included unless explicitly stated.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use colons between time units.  
- Do not use AM/PM.  
- Do not include time zone names unless required by the original.
