[Date Format]

Definition:  
Italian dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is included, it must appear **before the date**, without a comma.  
Slashes (`/`) are used in short format.

Examples:  
- lunedì 28 luglio 2025  
- 28 luglio 2025  
- 28 lug 2025  
- 28/07/25  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Ensure the order is Day → Month → Year.  
- If a weekday is present, place it before the date with no comma.  
- Accept both full and abbreviated month names.  
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it is explicitly present in the source.**
- **Do not generate a year unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
