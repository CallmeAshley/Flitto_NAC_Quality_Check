[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Italian uses continental European formatting:  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.  
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00  
- 5,00  
- 12.000  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use dots for digit grouping in the integer part.  
- Use commas for decimal points.  
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal point.  
- No space should appear between digits and punctuation.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
