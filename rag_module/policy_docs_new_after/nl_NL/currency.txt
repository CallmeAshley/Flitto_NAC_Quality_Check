[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Dutch conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, KRW, GBP, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dollar`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols (e.g., €) are placed **before the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- € 1.234,56  
- $ 850,00  
- ¥ 10.000,00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Symbol must precede the number.  
- A space must exist between symbol and number.  
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules for the number.  
- Do not replace symbols with names or codes.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD) are placed **after the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 EUR  
- 2.000,00 USD  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Code must appear after the number.  
- Use a space between number and code.  
- Use proper casing (e.g., EUR).  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euro,” “dollar,” or “yen” are placed **after the number**, with a **space**.  
Currency names should be written in **lowercase**, as is typical in Dutch.

Examples:  
- 1.000 euro  
- 850 dollar  
- 10.000 yen  
- 500 pond  
- 1.200 won  
- 300 yuan  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency name must follow the number with a space.  
- Names should be lowercase.  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate names unless they appear in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
