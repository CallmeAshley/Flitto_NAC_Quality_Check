[Date Format]

Definition:  
Dutch dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before** the date without a comma.  
Slashes or dashes may be used in short formats.

Examples:  
- maandag 28 juli 2025  
- 28 juli 2025  
- 28 jul 2025  
- 28-07-2025  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm the date follows Day → Month → Year order.  
- Weekdays, if included, must appear before the date with no comma.  
- Accept both long-form and abbreviated month names.  
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
