[Time Format]

Definition:  
Dutch uses the **24-hour clock** with colons (`:`) between time units.  
AM/PM is not used.  
Time zones should only appear if present in the source.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use colons to separate hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Do not use AM/PM markers.  
- Time zones such as “Midden-Europese zomertijd” or “CEST” should only be included if present in the source.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
