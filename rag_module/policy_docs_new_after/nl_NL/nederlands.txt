[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Dutch uses continental European formatting:  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.  
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use a dot for digit grouping in the integer part.  
- Use a comma for decimal points.  
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal.  
- No spaces between digits and separators.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Dutch conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, KRW, GBP, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dollar`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

- ¥ 10.000,00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Symbol must precede the number.  
- A space must exist between symbol and number.

- Do not replace symbols with names or codes.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD) are placed **after the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 EUR  
- 2.000,00 USD  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Code must appear after the number.  
- Use a space between number and code.  
- Use proper casing (e.g., EUR).  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euro,” “dollar,” or “yen” are placed **after the number**, with a **space**.  
Currency names should be written in **lowercase**, as is typical in Dutch.

Examples:  
- 1.000 euro  
- 850 dollar  
- 10.000 yen  
- 500 pond  
- 1.200 won  
- 300 yuan  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency name must follow the number with a space.  
- Names should be lowercase.  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate names unless they appear in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Dutch dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before** the date without a comma.  
Slashes or dashes may be used in short formats.

Examples:  
- maandag 28 juli 2025  
- 28 juli 2025  
- 28 jul 2025  
- 28-07-2025  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm the date follows Day → Month → Year order.  
- Weekdays, if included, must appear before the date with no comma.  
- Accept both long-form and abbreviated month names.  
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Dutch uses the **24-hour clock** with colons (`:`) between time units.  
AM/PM is not used.  
Time zones should only appear if present in the source.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use colons to separate hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Do not use AM/PM markers.  
- Time zones such as “Midden-Europese zomertijd” or “CEST” should only be included if present in the source.
