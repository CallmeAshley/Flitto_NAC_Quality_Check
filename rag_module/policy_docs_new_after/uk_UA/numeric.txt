[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Ukrainian uses continental European-style formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used for decimal points.
- A **space** is used every three digits for grouping in the integer part.
- No grouping is used after the decimal.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56  
- 123 456 789,00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a space as the thousands separator.
- Use a comma (`,`) for the decimal separator.
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal point.
- Do not use dots or inconsistent spacing.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
