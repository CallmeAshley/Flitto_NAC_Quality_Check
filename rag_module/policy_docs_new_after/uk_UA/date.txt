[Date Format]

Definition:  
Ukrainian dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it must appear **before** the date and be followed by a comma.  
The abbreviation “р.” (for “рік”) follows the year.

Examples:  
- понеділок, 28 липня 2025 р.  
- 28 липня 2025 р.  
- 28.07.2025  
- 28.07.25

Evaluation Criteria:
- Confirm Day → Month → Year order.
- If weekday is present, place before the date with comma.
- Do not generate weekday if absent in the source.
- Include “р.” if it appears in the original.
- Accept both full month and short numerical formats.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
