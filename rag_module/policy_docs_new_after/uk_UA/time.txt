[Time Format]

Definition:  
Ukrainian uses the **24-hour clock**, separated by colons (`:`).  
Time zones (e.g., EET) appear only when explicitly present.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM.
- Always use two digits (e.g., 09:00 not 9:0).
- Include time zones only if in the source.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
