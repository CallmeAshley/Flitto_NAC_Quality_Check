**If a colloquial or conversational currency expression is commonly accepted in the target locale, do not forcefully modify it according to the [Currency Format] guideline. Prioritize naturalness and local usage.**

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Ukrainian hryvnia (₴), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Ukrainian conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
NT$, ₴, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
UAH, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY(abbreviation: TL), AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, NZD

Important:  
Always preserve the original representation type (symbol, code, or name) **unless the Ukrainian locale customarily uses a different format and the intended meaning is preserved**.  
For example, `$400` may be translated as `400 доларів` if this is standard and grammatically appropriate in Ukrainian.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as `₴`, `$`, `€` appear **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 12 345,00 ₴  
- 10 000,00 €  
- 850,00 $
- 1 520,29 $

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and symbol.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for the number.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., UAH, USD) appear **after the number**, separated by a space.

Examples:  
- 12 345,00 UAH  
- 850,00 USD  
- 10 000,00 EUR

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a space between number and code.
- Use uppercase ISO codes.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

---

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “гривень”, “доларів”, or “єн” appear **after the number**, with a space.  
Ukrainian uses grammatical declension depending on quantity (e.g., долар → доларів).

Examples:  
- 1 000 гривень  
- 850 доларів  
- 10 000 єн  
- 300 євро  
- 1 200 вонів

Evaluation Criteria:
- Name must appear after the number with a space.
- Use correct declension based on quantity.
- Do not generate currency names unless present in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
