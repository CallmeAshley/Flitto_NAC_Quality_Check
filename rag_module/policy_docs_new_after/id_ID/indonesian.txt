[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Indonesian uses continental-style formatting:  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part as a grouping separator.  
- No grouping is used after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00  
- 12.000  
- 5,00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use a dot (`.`) for grouping only in the integer part.  
- Use a comma (`,`) for decimal points.  
- Do not insert grouping after the decimal point.  
- No space should appear between digits and symbols.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the Indonesian rupiah (Rp), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Indonesian conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
Rp, $, €, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
IDR, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dolar`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

- IDR 1.234,56  
- USD 2.000,00  
- EUR 800,00

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as "rupiah", "dolar", or "yen" are written **after the number**, usually with a space.

Examples:  
- 1.000 rupiah  
- 850 dolar  
- 10.000 yen  
- 500 euro  
- 300 pound  
- 1.200 won

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency name must follow the number with a space.

- Do not generate a currency name unless one exists in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Indonesian dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is included, it must appear **before the date**.  
Slashes (`/`) are commonly used in short formats.

Examples:  
- Senin, 28 Juli 2025  
- 28 Juli 2025  
- 28 Jul 2025  
- 28/07/25

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Ensure the date is in Day → Month → Year order.  
- If the weekday is present, it must appear before the date.  
- Accept both full and abbreviated month names.  
- Do not generate a weekday unless it is explicitly present in the source.

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Indonesian uses the **24-hour clock**, and periods (`.`) are used instead of colons between time units.  
Time zone names are not included unless explicitly present.

Examples:  
- 14.30  
- 14.30.45  
- 14.30.45 Waktu Indonesia Barat

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use **periods (`.`)** between hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Do not include AM/PM.  
- Do not include time zone names unless explicitly stated in the original.
