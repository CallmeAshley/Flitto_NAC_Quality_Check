[Numeric Format]
Definition:  
Indonesian uses continental-style formatting:  
- A comma (`,`) is used to represent decimal points.  
- A dot (`.`) is used every three digits in the integer part as a grouping separator.  
- No grouping is used after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00  
- 12.000  
- 5,00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use a dot (`.`) for grouping only in the integer part.
- Use a comma (`,`) for decimal points.
- Apply grouping exclusively before the decimal point.
- No space should appear between digits and symbols.

[Exceptions]
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators
- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.
- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
