[Time Format]
Definition:  
Indonesian uses the 24-hour clock, and periods (`.`) are used instead of colons between time units.  
Include time zones (e.g., CEST) only when explicitly required.

Examples:  
- 14.30  
- 14.30.45  
- 14.30.45 Waktu Indonesia Barat

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use periods (`.`) between hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Always express time in 24-hour format without AM/PM.
- Include time zone names only when explicitly stated in the original.

[Exceptions]
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators
- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.
- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
