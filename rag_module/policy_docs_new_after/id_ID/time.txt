[Time Format]

Definition:  
Indonesian uses the **24-hour clock**, and periods (`.`) are used instead of colons between time units.  
Time zone names are not included unless explicitly present.

Examples:  
- 14.30  
- 14.30.45  
- 14.30.45 Waktu Indonesia Barat

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use **periods (`.`)** between hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Do not include AM/PM.  
- Do not include time zone names unless explicitly stated in the original.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
