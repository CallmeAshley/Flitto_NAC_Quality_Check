[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the Indonesian rupiah (Rp), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Indonesian conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
Rp, $, €, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
IDR, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dolar`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., Rp) is placed **before the number** with **no space**.

Examples:  
- Rp1.234,56  
- $850,00  
- €2.000,00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must appear immediately before the number.  
- Do not insert a space.  
- Follow number formatting as defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Preserve the original symbol from the source.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., IDR, USD) are also placed **before the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- IDR 1.234,56  
- USD 2.000,00  
- EUR 800,00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use a space between the code and the number.  
- Code must appear before the number.  
- Follow the rules from the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Preserve the original format.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as "rupiah", "dolar", or "yen" are written **after the number**, usually with a space.

Examples:  
- 1.000 rupiah  
- 850 dolar  
- 10.000 yen  
- 500 euro  
- 300 pound  
- 1.200 won

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency name must follow the number with a space.  
- The name should match the referenced currency in context.  
- Follow the number formatting rules from the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless one exists in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
