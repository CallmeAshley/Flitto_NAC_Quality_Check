[Time Format]

Definition:  
Taiwan uses both **12-hour** and **24-hour** systems.  
- In the 12-hour format, use AM/PM markers such as 上午, 下午, 凌晨.
- Markers must appear **before the time**.
- Time is separated by colons (`:`).
- Do not include time zone unless explicitly mentioned.

Examples:  
- 上午2:30  
- 下午14:30  
- 14:30:45  
- 上午2:30:45 中華民國標準時間

Evaluation Criteria:
- Accept both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- Ensure AM/PM markers precede the time in 12-hour cases.
- Only include time zones if present in the source.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
