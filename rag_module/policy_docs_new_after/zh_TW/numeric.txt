[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Traditional Chinese in Taiwan follows Western-style numeric formatting, but native large number units (e.g., 萬, 億, 兆) are used in natural language.

- A **dot (`.`)** is used for decimal points.
- A **comma (`,`)** is used every three digits in the integer part.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.
- Do not generate unit-based expressions unless present in the source (e.g., 10萬).

Examples:  
- 1,234.56  
- 12,345,678 → 1234萬5678 (if expressed in native units)

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use commas for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a dot for decimal points.
- Do not group digits after the decimal.
- Ignore unit-based rewrites unless explicitly present in the original.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
