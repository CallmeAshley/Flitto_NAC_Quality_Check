[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Traditional Chinese in Taiwan follows Western-style numeric formatting, but native large number units (e.g., 萬, 億, 兆) are used in natural language.

- A **dot (`.`)** is used for decimal points.
- A **comma (`,`)** is used every three digits in the integer part.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.
- Do not generate unit-based expressions unless present in the source (e.g., 10萬).

Examples:  
- 1,234.56  
- 12,345,678 → 1234萬5678 (if expressed in native units)

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use commas for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a dot for decimal points.
- Do not group digits after the decimal.
- Ignore unit-based rewrites unless explicitly present in the original.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the New Taiwan Dollar (NT$), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Traditional Chinese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
NT$, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
TWD, USD, EUR, JPY, CNY, KRW, GBP, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400美元`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as `NT$`, `$`, `¥` are placed **before the number** with **no space** in between.

Examples:  
- NT$1,234.56  
- $1,234.56  
- ¥10,000

Evaluation Criteria:
- The symbol must be placed directly before the number.
- No space is allowed between the symbol and the number.
- Number must follow [Numeric Format] rules.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., TWD, USD, EUR) appear **after the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56 TWD  
- 850.00 USD  
- 10,000.00 EUR

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and code.
- Use uppercase letters for currency codes.
- Follow [Numeric Format] for number formatting.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “元”, “美元”, or “日圓” are written **after the number**, usually **without a space**.

Examples:  
- 1,000元  
- 850美元  
- 10,000日圓  
- 300歐元  
- 1,200韓元

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must come after the number with no space.
- Use proper traditional Chinese names for each currency.
- Do not generate currency names unless they appear in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Taiwan follows the **Year → Month → Day** format (e.g., 2025年7月28日).  
If a weekday is included, it is placed **after** the date, separated by a space.  
Short formats may use `/` or `-`.

Examples:  
- 2025年7月28日 星期一  
- 2025年7月28日  
- 2025/7/28  
- 2025-7-28

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use Year → Month → Day order.
- If a weekday exists, place it after the date with a space.
- Accept long-form (`年/月/日`) and short-form (`/` or `-`) formats.
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Taiwan uses both **12-hour** and **24-hour** systems.  
- In the 12-hour format, use AM/PM markers such as 上午, 下午, 凌晨.
- Markers must appear **before the time**.
- Time is separated by colons (`:`).
- Do not include time zone unless explicitly mentioned.

Examples:  
- 上午2:30  
- 下午14:30  
- 14:30:45  
- 上午2:30:45 中華民國標準時間

Evaluation Criteria:
- Accept both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.
- Ensure AM/PM markers precede the time in 12-hour cases.
- Only include time zones if present in the source.
