[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the New Taiwan Dollar (NT$), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Traditional Chinese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
NT$, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
TWD, USD, EUR, JPY, CNY, KRW, GBP, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400美元`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as `NT$`, `$`, `¥` are placed **before the number** with **no space** in between.

Examples:  
- NT$1,234.56  
- $1,234.56  
- ¥10,000

Evaluation Criteria:
- The symbol must be placed directly before the number.
- No space is allowed between the symbol and the number.
- Number must follow [Numeric Format] rules.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., TWD, USD, EUR) appear **after the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56 TWD  
- 850.00 USD  
- 10,000.00 EUR

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and code.
- Use uppercase letters for currency codes.
- Follow [Numeric Format] for number formatting.

---

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “元”, “美元”, or “日圓” are written **after the number**, usually **without a space**.

Examples:  
- 1,000元  
- 850美元  
- 10,000日圓  
- 300歐元  
- 1,200韓元

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must come after the number with no space.
- Use proper traditional Chinese names for each currency.
- Do not generate currency names unless they appear in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
