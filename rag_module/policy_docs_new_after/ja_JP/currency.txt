[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the Japanese yen (円 or ￥), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Japanese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
NT$, ￥, $, €, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
JPY, USD, EUR, KRW, CNY, GBP, INR, RUB, TRY(abbreviation: TL), AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Always preserve the original representation type (symbol, code, or name) **unless the Japanese locale customarily uses a different format and the intended meaning is preserved**.  
For example, `$400` may be translated as `400ドル` if this representation is standard and contextually appropriate in Japanese.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., ￥) is placed **directly before the number** without any space.

Examples:  
- ￥1,234.56  
- $850.00  
- €2,000.00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must appear immediately before the number.  
- No space should be inserted.  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., JPY, USD) are also placed **before the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- JPY 1,234.56  
- USD 2,000.00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use a space between code and number.  
- Code must appear before the number.  
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Preserve the original code type.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “円” (yen), “ドル” (dollar), or “ユーロ” (euro) are typically placed **after the number**, without a space.

Examples:  
- 1,000円  
- 850ドル  
- 10,000ユーロ  
- 300ポンド  
- 500ウォン  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency names must follow the number with **no space**.  
- The name must match the intended currency in Japanese.  
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate currency names unless explicitly in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
