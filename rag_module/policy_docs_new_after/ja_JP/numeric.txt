[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Japanese uses Western-style numeric formatting:  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.  
- Grouping is not applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56  
- 123,456,789.00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use commas in the integer part only.  
- Use a dot for decimal points.  
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal.  
- No space should appear between digits and punctuation.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
