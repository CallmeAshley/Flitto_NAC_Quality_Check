[Date Format]

Definition:  
Japanese dates follow the **Year → Month → Day** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **after the full date**, without punctuation.  
Slash (`/`) formats may also be used.

Examples:  
- 2025年7月28日月曜日  
- 2025年7月28日  
- 2025/07/28  
- 25/07/28  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Ensure date order is Year → Month → Day.  
- If a weekday is present, it must follow the full date without punctuation.  
- Accept both kanji-based and slash-based formats.  
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**
- **Do not generate a year unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
