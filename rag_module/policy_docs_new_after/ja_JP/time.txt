[Time Format]

Definition:  
Japanese uses the **24-hour clock** system.  
- The full format uses **kanji units** for hours (時), minutes (分), and seconds (秒).  
- Colons (`:`) are used in digital or abbreviated formats.  
- Time zone names (e.g., 日本標準時) should not be included unless explicitly stated in the source.

Examples:  
- 14時30分45秒  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use either kanji-based or colon-based format depending on context.  
- Do not use AM/PM.  
- Do not include time zone unless present in the original.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
