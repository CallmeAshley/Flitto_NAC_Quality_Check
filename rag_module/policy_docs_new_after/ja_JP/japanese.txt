[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Japanese uses Western-style numeric formatting:  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.  
- Grouping is not applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56  
- 123,456,789.00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use commas in the integer part only.  
- Use a dot for decimal points.  
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal.  
- No space should appear between digits and punctuation.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the Japanese yen (円 or ￥), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Japanese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
￥, $, €, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
JPY, USD, EUR, KRW, CNY, GBP, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400ドル`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., ￥) is placed **directly before the number** without any space.

Examples:  
- ￥1,234.56  
- $850.00  
- €2,000.00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must appear immediately before the number.  
- No space should be inserted.  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., JPY, USD) are also placed **before the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- JPY 1,234.56  
- USD 2,000.00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use a space between code and number.  
- Code must appear before the number.  
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Preserve the original code type.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “円” (yen), “ドル” (dollar), or “ユーロ” (euro) are typically placed **after the number**, without a space.

Examples:  
- 1,000円  
- 850ドル  
- 10,000ユーロ  
- 300ポンド  
- 500ウォン  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency names must follow the number with **no space**.  
- The name must match the intended currency in Japanese.  
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate currency names unless explicitly in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Japanese dates follow the **Year → Month → Day** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **after the full date**, without punctuation.  
Slash (`/`) formats may also be used.

Examples:  
- 2025年7月28日月曜日  
- 2025年7月28日  
- 2025/07/28  
- 25/07/28  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Ensure date order is Year → Month → Day.  
- If a weekday is present, it must follow the full date without punctuation.  
- Accept both kanji-based and slash-based formats.  
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Japanese uses the **24-hour clock** system.  
- The full format uses **kanji units** for hours (時), minutes (分), and seconds (秒).  
- Colons (`:`) are used in digital or abbreviated formats.  
- Time zone names (e.g., 日本標準時) should not be included unless explicitly stated in the source.

Examples:  
- 14時30分45秒  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use either kanji-based or colon-based format depending on context.  
- Do not use AM/PM.  
- Do not include time zone unless present in the original.
