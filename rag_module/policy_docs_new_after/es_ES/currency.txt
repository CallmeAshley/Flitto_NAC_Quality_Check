[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Spanish conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾  

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dólares`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as `€`, `$`, `¥`, etc. appear **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 12.345,00 €  
- 850,00 $  
- 10.000,00 ¥  
- 1.200,00 ₩  
- 300,00 £

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and symbol.
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD) are written **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 12.345,00 EUR  
- 2.000,00 USD  
- 10.000,00 JPY

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and code.
- Use uppercase for currency codes.
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euros,” “dólares,” or “yenes” appear **after the number**, usually with a space.  
Currency names follow Spanish grammatical rules and pluralization.

Examples:  
- 1.000 euros  
- 850 dólares  
- 10.000 yenes  
- 500 libras  
- 1.200 wons  
- 300 yuanes

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must follow the number with a space.
- Use the grammatically correct Spanish form of the currency name.
- Do not generate a currency name unless one exists in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
