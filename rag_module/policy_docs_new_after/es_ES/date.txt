[Date Format]

Definition:  
Spanish dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
The preposition “de” is used between components in long formats.  
Slashes (`/`) are used in short formats.

Examples:  
- lunes, 28 de julio de 2025  
- 28 de julio de 2025  
- 28 jul 2025  
- 28/7/25

Evaluation Criteria:
- Ensure date order is Day → Month → Year.
- If a weekday is present, place it before the date with a comma.
- Accept both long-form (with “de”) and short-form (with slashes) formats.
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it is present in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
