[Locale: es-ES]

[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Spanish uses continental European formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a dot for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a comma for decimal points.
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal.
- No spaces between digits and separators.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Spanish conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾  

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dólares`) or **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euros,” “dólares,” or “yenes” appear **after the number**, usually with a space.  
Currency names follow Spanish grammatical rules and pluralization.

Examples:  
- 1.000 euros  
- 850 dólares

- Use the grammatically correct Spanish form of the currency name.
- Do not generate a currency name unless one exists in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Spanish dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
The preposition “de” is used between components in long formats.  
Slashes (`/`) are used in short formats.

Examples:  
- lunes, 28 de julio de 2025  
- 28 de julio de 2025  
- 28 jul 2025  
- 28/7/25

Evaluation Criteria:
- Ensure date order is Day → Month → Year.
- If a weekday is present, place it before the date with a comma.
- Accept both long-form (with “de”) and short-form (with slashes) formats.
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it is present in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Spanish uses the **24-hour clock**.  
Colons (`:`) separate hours, minutes, and seconds.  
Time zones (e.g., CEST) are not included unless explicitly required.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM markers.
- Only include time zone names if present in the original.
