[Date Format]
Definition:  
German dates follow the Day → Month → Year order.  
Dots (`.`) are used as separators.  
If a weekday is present, it appears before the date, followed by a comma.  

Examples:
- Montag, 28. Juli 2025
- 28. Juli 2025
- Montag, 28. Juli
- 28.07.2025
- 28.07.25
- 28.07
- Montag, 28.07

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm the order is Day → Month → Year.  
- If the weekday is present, it should be placed before the date and separated by a comma.  
- Accept both textual and numeric formats.  
- Only generate a year if it exists in the source.

[Exceptions]
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
