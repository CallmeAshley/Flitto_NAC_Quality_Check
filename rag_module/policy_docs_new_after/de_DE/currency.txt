[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning, spacing, and casing** should be adjusted according to German conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, NT$, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, CNY, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY(abbreviation: TL), AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats **unless the target locale customarily uses a different format and the meaning is preserved**.  
For example, if the source uses a symbol (e.g., `$400`), it can be translated as `400 Dollar` **if the name format is widely accepted in the German locale**.  
The same applies in reverse.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., €) is placed **after the number**, with a **regular space** in between.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 €  
- 2.000,00 $  
- 850,00 ¥

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must follow the number with a space.  
- Numeric formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Preserve the original symbol from the source without changing the format.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD) also appear **after the number**, separated by a space.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 EUR  
- 2.000,00 USD  
- 800,00 JPY

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Code must follow the number with a space.  
- Use correct casing (e.g., EUR not eur).  
- Follow the rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Do not rewrite the code as a name or symbol.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “Euro,” “Dollar,” or “Yen” appear **after the number**, usually with a space.  
In German, all currency names are capitalized.

Examples:  
- 1.000 Euro  
- 850 Dollar  
- 10.000 Yen  
- 500 Pfund  
- 300 Rubel  
- 1.200 Won

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must be written after the number with a space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency and be capitalized.  
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless it exists in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
