[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
German uses continental European numeric formatting:  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.  
- No grouping is used after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00  
- Invalid: 1234567,89 (missing grouping)  
- Invalid: 1,000.50 (wrong separators)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use dots for grouping in the integer part.  
- Use a comma for decimal points.  
- Do not use grouping after the decimal point.  
- No space should exist between digits and separators.  
- Accept any number of decimal places if separators are correct.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning, spacing, and casing** should be adjusted according to German conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, GBP, CNY, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 Dollar`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., €) is placed **after the number**, with a **regular space** in between.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 €  
- 2.000,00 $  
- 850,00 ¥

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must follow the number with a space.  
- Numeric formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Preserve the original symbol from the source without changing the format.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., EUR, USD) also appear **after the number**, separated by a space.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 EUR  
- 2.000,00 USD  
- 800,00 JPY

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Code must follow the number with a space.  
- Use correct casing (e.g., EUR not eur).  
- Follow the rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Do not rewrite the code as a name or symbol.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “Euro,” “Dollar,” or “Yen” appear **after the number**, usually with a space.  
In German, all currency names are capitalized.

Examples:  
- 1.000 Euro  
- 850 Dollar  
- 10.000 Yen  
- 500 Pfund  
- 300 Rubel  
- 1.200 Won

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must be written after the number with a space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency and be capitalized.  
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless it exists in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
German dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
Dots (`.`) are used as separators.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
Do not generate a weekday unless explicitly present in the source.

Examples:  
- Montag, 28. Juli 2025  
- 28. Juli 2025  
- 28.07.2025  
- 28.07.25

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm the order is Day → Month → Year.  
- If the weekday is present, it should be placed before the date and separated by a comma.  
- Accept both textual and numeric formats.  
- Do not add a weekday unless explicitly required by the source.

[Time Format]

Definition:  
German uses the **24-hour clock** in both spoken and written contexts.  
Colons (`:`) are used to separate time units.  
AM/PM is not used.  
Time zones should not be included unless explicitly present in the original.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use colons between hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Do not use AM/PM.  
- Do not include time zone names unless explicitly required.
