[Time Format]

Definition:  
German uses the **24-hour clock** in both spoken and written contexts.  
Colons (`:`) are used to separate time units.  
AM/PM is not used.  
Time zones should not be included unless explicitly present in the original.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use colons between hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Do not use AM/PM.  
- Do not include time zone names unless explicitly required.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
