[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
German uses continental European numeric formatting:  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.  
- No grouping is used after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00  
- Invalid: 1234567,89 (missing grouping)  
- Invalid: 1,000.50 (wrong separators)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use dots for grouping in the integer part.  
- Use a comma for decimal points.  
- Do not use grouping after the decimal point.  
- No space should exist between digits and separators.  
- Accept any number of decimal places if separators are correct.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
