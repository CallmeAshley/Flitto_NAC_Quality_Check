[Date Format]

Definition:  
Arabic dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is included, it must appear **before the date**.  
Western-style slashes (`/`) are used in medium/short forms, with Arabic numerals.  
Do not generate a weekday unless it is explicitly present in the source.

Examples:  
- الاثنين، ٢٨ يوليو ٢٠٢٥ م  
- ٢٨ يوليو ٢٠٢٥ م  
- ٢٨‏/٠٧‏/٢٠٢٥  
- ٢٨‏/٧‏/٢٥

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm that the date is in Day → Month → Year order.  
- If a weekday is included, ensure it appears before the date.  
- Use Arabic digits and grammar, including `م` for Gregorian years when applicable.  
- Do not add weekdays unless explicitly present in the source.
- **Do not generate a year unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
