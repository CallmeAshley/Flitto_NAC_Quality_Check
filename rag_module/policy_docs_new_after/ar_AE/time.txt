[Time Format]

Definition:  
Arabic uses the **12-hour clock** with `ص` for AM and `م` for PM.  
Colons (`:`) are used to separate hours, minutes, and seconds.  
Do not include time zone names unless explicitly present in the original.

Examples:  
- ٢:٣٠ ص  
- ٢:٣٠:٤٥ ص  
- ٢:٣٠:٤٥ م  
- ٢:٣٠:٤٥ م على توقيت الخليج الرسمي

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use Arabic digits and punctuation.  
- `ص` must be used for AM, `م` for PM.  
- Colons separate time units.  
- Omit time zones unless explicitly required.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
