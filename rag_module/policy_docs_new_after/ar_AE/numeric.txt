[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Arabic uses localized numeric formatting:  
- A **Arabic decimal separator (٫)** is used for decimal points.  
- An **Arabic thousands separator (٬)** is used every three digits in the integer part.  
- These are different Unicode characters from Western commas and dots.

Examples:  
- ١٬٠٠٠  
- ١٬٢٣٤٫٥٦  
- Invalid: ١٫٠٠٠٬٥٦ (wrong separators)  
- Invalid: ١٢٣٤٥٦٧٫٨٩ (missing grouping)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use `٬` as the grouping separator in the integer part.  
- Use `٫` as the decimal separator.  
- Grouping must not be used after the decimal point.  
- Use Arabic digits and Arabic separators only.  
- Accept any number of decimal places if separators are applied correctly.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
