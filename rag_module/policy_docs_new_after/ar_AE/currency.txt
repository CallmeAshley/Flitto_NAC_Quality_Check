[Currency Format]

Note:  
While the following rules provide strict formatting guidelines, LLMs must prioritize semantic consistency and contextual appropriateness.  
If the translated sentence's format clearly matches the source meaning and local convention, **do not penalize minor structural variations**.
For example, converting a currency symbol format in the source sentence to a currency name format in the translated sentence is acceptable if the target locale customarily uses the name format.

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle various currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the local one (e.g., درهم), the original format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adjusted according to Arabic formatting rules.

Expected currency symbols include:  
د.إ, $, NT$, €, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO codes include:  
AED, USD, EUR, JPY, CNY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY(abbreviation: TL), AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Arabic currency symbols (e.g., د.إ for UAE Dirham) appear **after the number**, preceded by a **space**.  
Arabic digits and separators must be used.

Examples:  
- ١٬٢٣٤٫٥٦ د.إ  
- ٨٥٠٬٠٠ $  
- ٢٬٠٠٠٬٠٠ €  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol comes after the number.  
- A space is used between the number and symbol.  
- Use Arabic digits and proper numeric formatting.  
- Do not convert to other currency formats.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., AED, USD) appear **after the number**, with a **space** in between.

Examples:  
- ١٬٢٣٤٫٥٦ AED  
- ٨٬٥٠٠٫٠٠ USD  
- ١٬٠٠٠٫٠٠ JPY

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Code must follow the number.  
- Use a space between number and code.  
- Follow Arabic number formatting.  
- Do not rewrite code as a name or symbol.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names (e.g., درهم, ريال, دولار) follow the number and are separated by a space.  
Names should match the directionality and grammar of Arabic text.  
Currency symbols or codes in the source sentence **may be converted into names** in the translation **if the Arabic locale customarily uses the name format and the meaning is preserved.**

Examples:  
- ١٬٠٠٠ درهم  
- ٨٥٠ دولار  
- ١٠٬٠٠٠ ين  
- ٥٠٠ يورو  
- ٣٠٠ جنيه  
- ١٬٢٠٠ وون

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Currency name must appear after the number, with a space.  
- Number format and digit style must follow Arabic conventions.  
- Do not use Western digits or punctuation.  
- Ensure semantic equivalence if converting from symbols or codes to names.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
