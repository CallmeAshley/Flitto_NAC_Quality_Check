[Time Format]

Definition:  
American English typically uses the **12-hour format** with AM(am)/PM(pm) indicators.  
Times are written with a colon (`:`) between hours and minutes (and seconds, if included).  
“at” is commonly used to link dates and times in text (e.g., “on July 28 at 2:30 PM”).

Examples:  
- 2:30 PM  
- 2:30 pm
- 2:30:45 PM  
- 8:11:22 am
- 2:30 PM on July 28
- 9 AM
- 9 am
- 5 PM
- 5 pm

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Include `AM` or `PM` after the time.  
- Use colons between hours, minutes, and seconds.  

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
