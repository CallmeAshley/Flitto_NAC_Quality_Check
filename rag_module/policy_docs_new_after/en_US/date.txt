[Date Format]

Definition:  
American English uses the **Month → Day → Year** order.  
Slashes (`/`) or commas (`,`) may be used depending on the format style.  
If a weekday is present, it must appear **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
Do not add a weekday if it is not present in the source.

Examples:  
- Monday, July 28, 2025  
- July 28, 2025  
- Jul 28, 2025  
- 7/28/25

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Follow Month → Day → Year order when all components are present.  
- If a weekday is included, place it **before the date** and separate it with a comma.  
- Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
