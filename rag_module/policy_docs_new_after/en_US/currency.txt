[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not USD, the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to American English formatting rules.

Expected currency symbols include:  
$, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
USD, EUR, JPY, CNY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dollars`) or a **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same rule applies in reverse for codes and names.  
Always preserve the original representation type used in the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols like `$`, `€`, `£`, and `¥` appear **before the number with no space** in American English.

Examples:  
- $1,234.56  
- €2,000.00  
- £850.00  
- ¥10,000

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must be placed directly before the number.  
- There must be no space between the symbol and the number.  
- Use commas and dots according to the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Preserve the original symbol from the source.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes such as USD, EUR, GBP are written **after the number**, separated by a regular space.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56 USD  
- 2,000 EUR  
- 850 JPY

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency code must follow the number with a space.  
- The number format must follow the rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Preserve the ISO code used in the source.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names like “dollars,” “euros,” or “pounds” are typically written **after the number**, with a space.  
Do not change other representation types (symbol or code) into currency names.

Examples:  
- 1,000 dollars  
- 850 euros  
- 10,000 yen  
- 500 rupees  
- 300 pounds  
- 1,200 won

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must follow the number with a space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency.  
- Numeric formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless it exists in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
