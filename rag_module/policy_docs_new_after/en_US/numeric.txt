[Numeric Format]
Definition:  
American English uses Western-style numeric formatting:  
- A comma (`,`) is used every three digits in the integer part.  
- A dot (`.`) is used to represent decimal points.  
- Commas must not appear after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1,000  
- 12,345.67  
- Invalid: 12,345.678,900  
- Invalid: 1.000,25 (wrong decimal separator)  
- Invalid: 1000 (missing thousand separator)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Comma (`,`) grouping is used only in the integer part.  
- Decimal points must be written using a dot (`.`).  
- No space appears between digits and separators.  
- Accept numbers with any decimal precision if separators are applied correctly.

[Exceptions]
- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators
- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.
- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
- Numeric abbreviations such as 200k or 3m should not be modified.
