[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
American English uses Western-style numeric formatting:  
- A comma (`,`) is used every three digits in the integer part.  
- A dot (`.`) is used to represent decimal points.  
- Commas must not appear after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1,000  
- 12,345.67  
- Invalid: 12,345.678,900  
- Invalid: 1.000,25 (wrong decimal separator)  
- Invalid: 1000 (missing thousand separator)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Comma (`,`) grouping is used only in the integer part.  
- Decimal points must be written using a dot (`.`).  
- No space appears between digits and separators.  
- Do not use commas in decimal places.  
- Accept numbers with any decimal precision if separators are applied correctly.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not USD, the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to American English formatting rules.

Expected currency symbols include:  
$, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
USD, EUR, JPY, CNY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dollars`) or a **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same rule applies in reverse for codes and names.  
Always preserve the original representation type used in the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols like `$`, `€`, `£`, and `¥` appear **before the number with no space** in American English.

Examples:  
- $1,234.56  
- €2,000.00  
- £850.00  
- ¥10,000

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must be placed directly before the number.  
- There must be no space between the symbol and the number.  
- Use commas and dots according to the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Preserve the original symbol from the source.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes such as USD, EUR, GBP are written **after the number**, separated by a regular space.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56 USD  
- 2,000 EUR  
- 850 JPY

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency code must follow the number with a space.  
- The number format must follow the rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Preserve the ISO code used in the source.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names like “dollars,” “euros,” or “pounds” are typically written **after the number**, with a space.  
Do not change other representation types (symbol or code) into currency names.

Examples:  
- 1,000 dollars  
- 850 euros  
- 10,000 yen  
- 500 rupees  
- 300 pounds  
- 1,200 won

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must follow the number with a space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency.  
- Numeric formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless it exists in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
American English uses the **Month → Day → Year** order.  
Slashes (`/`) or commas (`,`) may be used depending on the format style.  
If a weekday is present, it must appear **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
Do not add a weekday if it is not present in the source.

Examples:  
- Monday, July 28, 2025  
- July 28, 2025  
- Jul 28, 2025  
- 7/28/25

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Follow Month → Day → Year order when all components are present.  
- If a weekday is included, place it **before the date** and separate it with a comma.  
- Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.

[Time Format]

Definition:  
American English typically uses the **12-hour format** with AM/PM indicators.  
Times are written with a colon (`:`) between hours and minutes (and seconds, if included).  
“at” is commonly used to link dates and times in text (e.g., “on July 28 at 2:30 PM”).

Examples:  
- 2:30 PM  
- 2:30:45 PM  
- 2:30 PM on July 28

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Include `AM` or `PM` after the time.  
- Use colons between hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Do not include time zone markers (e.g., EDT, PST) unless explicitly present in the original.
