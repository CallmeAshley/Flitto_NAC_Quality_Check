[Time Format]

Definition:  
Simplified Chinese commonly uses the **24-hour format**.  
Colons (`:`) are used between hours, minutes, and seconds.  
AM/PM is not used, and time zones should be excluded unless explicitly required.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use 24-hour time with colons separating units.  
- Do not include AM/PM markers.  
- Do not include time zone names unless explicitly present in the original.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
