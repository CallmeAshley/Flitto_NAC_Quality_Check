[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the local yuan (¥), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adjusted according to Simplified Chinese formatting rules.

Expected currency symbols include:  
¥, $, €, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO codes include:  
CNY, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400美元`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
The currency symbol (e.g., ¥, $, €, £) appears **before the number** without any space.

Examples:  
- ¥1,234.56  
- $2,000.00  
- €850.00  
- £500.00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Place the symbol directly before the number with no space.  
- Number formatting must follow the rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Preserve the original symbol used in the source.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., CNY, USD, EUR) appear **after the number**, with a space in between.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56 CNY  
- 2,500.00 USD  
- 800.00 EUR

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The ISO code must follow the number.  
- Use a regular space between number and code.  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.  
- Preserve the code as it appears in the source.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names (e.g., 元, 美元, 日元) usually appear **after the number**, with **no space** in most cases.  
Do not rewrite currency symbols or codes into names.

Examples:  
- 1,000元  
- 850美元  
- 10,000日元  
- 500欧元  
- 300英镑  
- 1,200韩元

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Place the currency name after the number, typically with no space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency.  
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless it exists in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
