[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Simplified Chinese follows Western-style numeric formatting:  
- A **dot (`.`)** is used to represent decimal points.  
- A **comma (`,`)** is used every three digits in the integer part as a grouping separator.  
- No grouping should be applied after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1,234.56  
- 123,456,789.00  
- Invalid: 1234567.89 (missing grouping)  
- Invalid: 1.000,25 (wrong decimal separator)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use commas (`,`) for grouping only in the integer part.  
- Use a dot (`.`) for decimal points.  
- Do not insert spaces between digits or symbols.  
- Accept any number of decimal digits if separators are applied correctly.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
