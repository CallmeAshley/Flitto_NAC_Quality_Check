[Date Format]

Definition:  
Chinese dates follow the **Year → Month → Day** order, using native suffixes (`年`, `月`, `日`).  
If a weekday is present, it must appear **after the date**.  
Slashes (`/`) may be used in short format.

Examples:  
- 2025年7月28日星期一  
- 2025年7月28日  
- 2025/7/28

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Date must be ordered as Year → Month → Day.  
- If the weekday is present, it follows the date.  
- Accept both character-based (`年/月/日`) and slash-based formats.  
- Do not add a weekday unless explicitly present in the source.
- **Do not generate a year unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
