[Locale: pl-PL]

[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Polish uses continental European formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.
- A **space** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56  
- 123 456 789,00  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a space as the thousands separator in the integer part.
- Use a comma for decimal points.
- Do not group digits after the decimal.
- Do not use regular spaces or dots as separators.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Polish złoty (zł), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adjusted according to Polish conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
zł, €, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾  

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
PLN, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CNY, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD  

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dolarów`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

Definition:
