[Time Format]

Definition:  
Polish uses the **24-hour clock**.  
Colons (`:`) are used between hours, minutes, and seconds.  
Time zones such as “środkowoeuropejski czas letni” (Central European Summer Time) are not included unless explicitly required.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons (`:`) to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM markers.
- Time zones should be included only if present in the original.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
