[Date Format]

Definition:  
Polish dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before the date**, followed by a comma.  
Dots (`.`) can be used.
The abbreviation "r." (rok, roku) is commonly used to indicate a year.

Examples:  
- poniedziałek, 28 lipca 2025  
- 28 lipca 2025  
- 28 lip 2025  
- 28.07.2025  
- maj 2025 r.
- maju 2025 roku

Evaluation Criteria:
- Ensure the date is in Day → Month → Year order.
- If a weekday is present, it must precede the date and be followed by a comma.
- Accept both full month names and abbreviations.
- **Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.**
- **Do not generate a year unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
