[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Polish złoty (zł), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adjusted according to Polish conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
zł, €, $, ¥, £, ₹, ₩, ₽, ฿, ₱, ₪, ₴, ₫, ₺, ₦, ₨, ₵, ₡, ₮, ₸, ₾  

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
PLN, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CNY, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD  

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dolarów`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols like `zł` appear **after the number**, with a **space** in between.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56 zł  
- 2 000,00 $  
- 850,00 €  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and symbol.
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes like `PLN`, `USD` also appear **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1 234,56 PLN  
- 2 000,00 USD  
- 800,00 EUR  

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- Use a space before the code.
- Numeric formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] section.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “złoty”, “dolar”, or “jen” appear **after the number**, usually with a space.

Examples:  
- 1 000 złotych  
- 850 dolarów  
- 10 000 jenów  
- 500 euro  
- 300 funtów  
- 1 200 wonów  

Evaluation Criteria:
- The currency name must follow the number with a space.
- The name should match the grammatical form used in Polish.
- Use [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.
- Do not generate a currency name unless explicitly present in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
