[Date Format]

Definition:  
French uses the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before** the date.  
Slashes (`/`) can be used.
Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.

Examples:  
- lundi 28 juillet 2025  
- 28 juillet 2025  
- 28 juil. 2025  
- 28/07/2025

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm date order is Day → Month → Year when all parts are present.  
- If a weekday is included, place it before the date.  
- Accept both full name and slash formats depending on style.  
- Do not add weekdays unless explicitly present in the source.
- **Do not generate a year unless it exists in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
