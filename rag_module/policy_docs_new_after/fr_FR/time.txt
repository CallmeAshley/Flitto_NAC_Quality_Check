[Time Format]

Definition:  
French uses the **24-hour clock** in all written contexts.  
There is no AM/PM indicator.  
Colons (`:`) are used to separate hours, minutes, and seconds.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 09:05  
- 22:15:00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use colons between time units.  
- Do not use AM/PM or any time-of-day indicator.  
- Do not include time zone information unless explicitly stated in the original.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
