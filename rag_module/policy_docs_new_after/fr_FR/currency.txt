[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to French typographic conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
NT$, €, $, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₨, ₫, ₭, ₵, ₿, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, CNY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY(abbreviation: TL), AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Always preserve the original representation type (symbol, code, or name) **unless the French locale customarily uses a different form and the meaning remains clear and accurate**.  
For example, `$400` may be translated as `400 dollars` if this is contextually and conventionally appropriate in French.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as € are placed **after the number**, separated by a **space**.  
Within the number itself, use **spaces** for grouping.

Examples:  
- 12 345,00 €  
- 1 000,00 $  
- 850,00 ¥

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must appear after the number.  
- Use spaces for digit grouping and between the number and the currency symbol.  
- Number format must follow the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Preserve the symbol from the source without conversion.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes such as EUR, USD appear **after the number**, separated by a **space**.  
Digit grouping uses **spaces**.

Examples:  
- 12 345,00 EUR  
- 1 000,00 USD  
- 2 500,00 JPY

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency code appears after the number.  
- A space must be used between number and code.  
- Follow all rules from the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Do not convert the representation type.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euros,” “dollars,” or “livres” typically follow the number, with a space.  
Do not rewrite symbols or codes into names.

Examples:  
- 1 000 euros  
- 850 dollars  
- 10 000 yens  
- 500 livres  
- 300 roupies  
- 800 wons

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must come after the number, separated by a space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency.  
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless it exists in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
