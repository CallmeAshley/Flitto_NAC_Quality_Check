[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
French formatting uses:  
- A **comma (`,`)** as the decimal separator.  
- A **space** as the grouping separator every three digits in the integer part.  
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1 234,56  
- 123 456 789,00  
- Invalid: 1234567,89 (missing group separators)  
- Invalid: 1.000,25 (wrong decimal separator)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use commas for decimal points.  
- Use spaces every three digits in the integer part.  
- Do not use any grouping after the decimal separator.  
- No space should exist between digits and separators unless specified.  
- Accept numbers with any decimal precision if separators are applied correctly.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
