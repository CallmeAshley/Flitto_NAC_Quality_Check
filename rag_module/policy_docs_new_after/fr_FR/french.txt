[Locale: fr-FR]

[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
French formatting uses:  
- A **comma (`,`)** as the decimal separator.  
- A **space** as the grouping separator every three digits in the integer part.  
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1 234,56  
- 123 456 789,00  
- Invalid: 1234567,89 (missing group separators)  
- Invalid: 1.000,25 (wrong decimal separator)

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use commas for decimal points.  
- Use spaces every three digits in the integer part.  
- Do not use any grouping after the decimal separator.  
- No space should exist between digits and separators unless specified.  
- Accept numbers with any decimal precision if separators are applied correctly.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not the euro (€), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to French typographic conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
€, $, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₨, ₫, ₭, ₵, ₿, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
EUR, USD, JPY, CNY, GBP, KRW, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 dollars`) or a **code** (`USD 400`).  
The same rule applies in reverse for codes and names.  
Always preserve the original representation type used in the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as € are placed **after the number**, separated by a **space**.  
Within the number itself, use **spaces** for grouping.

Examples:  
- 12 345,00 €  
- 1 000,00 $  
- 850,00 ¥

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The symbol must appear after the number.  
- Use spaces for digit grouping and between the number and the currency symbol.  
- Number format must follow the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Preserve the symbol from the source without conversion.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes such as EUR, USD appear **after the number**, separated by a **space**.  
Digit grouping uses **spaces**.

Examples:  
- 12 345,00 EUR  
- 1 000,00 USD  
- 2 500,00 JPY

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency code appears after the number.  
- A space must be used between number and code.  
- Follow all rules from the [Numeric Format] section.  
- Do not convert the representation type.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “euros,” “dollars,” or “livres” typically follow the number, with a space.  
Do not rewrite symbols or codes into names.

Examples:  
- 1 000 euros  
- 850 dollars  
- 10 000 yens  
- 500 livres  
- 300 roupies  
- 800 wons

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must come after the number, separated by a space.  
- The name must match the referenced currency.  
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- Do not generate a currency name unless it exists in the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
French uses the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **before** the date.  
Slashes (`/`) are used in short format only; full names are used in other cases.  
Do not generate a weekday unless it exists in the source.

Examples:  
- lundi 28 juillet 2025  
- 28 juillet 2025  
- 28 juil. 2025  
- 28/07/2025

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm date order is Day → Month → Year when all parts are present.  
- If a weekday is included, place it before the date.  
- Accept both full name and slash formats depending on style.  
- Do not add weekdays unless explicitly present in the source.

[Time Format]

Definition:  
French uses the **24-hour clock** in all written contexts.  
There is no AM/PM indicator.  
Colons (`:`) are used to separate hours, minutes, and seconds.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 09:05  
- 22:15:00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Use colons between time units.  
- Do not use AM/PM or any time-of-day indicator.  
- Do not include time zone information unless explicitly stated in the original.
