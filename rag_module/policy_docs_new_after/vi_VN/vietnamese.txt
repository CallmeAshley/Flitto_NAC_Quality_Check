[Locale: vi-VN]

[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Vietnamese follows continental European numeric formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.
- No grouping is applied after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a dot (`.`) for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a comma (`,`) for decimal points.
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal.
- No spaces between digits and separators.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Vietnamese đồng (₫), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Vietnamese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
₫, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
VND, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 đô la`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

Definition:

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Vietnamese uses the **24-hour clock**, with colons (`:`) separating hours, minutes, and seconds.  
No AM/PM notation is used. Time zones may appear in formal contexts but should only be included if present in the source.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM.
- Always write hours and minutes with two digits (e.g., 09:00).
- Include time zone only if explicitly present.
