[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Vietnamese đồng (₫), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Vietnamese conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
₫, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
VND, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 đô la`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as `₫`, `$`, `€` appear **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 ₫  
- 850,00 $  
- 10.000,00 €

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and symbol.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for the number.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., VND, USD) are written **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 VND  
- 850,00 USD  
- 10.000,00 EUR

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and code.
- Use uppercase ISO codes.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for the number.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “đồng”, “đô la”, “yên”, “won”, or “euro” appear **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:

- 850 đô la  
- 10.000 yên  
- 500 won  
- 300 euro

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must follow the number with a space.
- Use proper Vietnamese grammar and word form.
- Do not generate currency names unless present in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for the number.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
