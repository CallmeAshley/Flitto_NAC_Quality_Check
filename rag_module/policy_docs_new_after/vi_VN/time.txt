[Time Format]

Definition:  
Vietnamese uses the **24-hour clock**, with colons (`:`) separating hours, minutes, and seconds.  
No AM/PM notation is used. Time zones may appear in formal contexts but should only be included if present in the source.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM.
- Always write hours and minutes with two digits (e.g., 09:00).
- Include time zone only if explicitly present.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
