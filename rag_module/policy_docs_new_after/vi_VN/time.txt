**[Time Format Exception - Informal Contexts]**

Do not convert natural or informal time expressions (e.g., "1 giờ sáng", "4⃣ giờ chiều") into strict numerical formats like "01:00" or "16:00" if the original translation:

- Clearly conveys the correct meaning
- Matches the emotional tone or conversational context
- Contains culturally natural or commonly used expressions in the target language

Preserve the informal expression unless it introduces ambiguity or contradicts readability norms in the target locale.

This rule especially applies in quotes, dialogues, or expressive texts where tone and voice must be maintained.


[Time Format]

Definition:  
Vietnamese uses the **24-hour clock**, with colons (`:`) separating hours, minutes, and seconds.  
Vietnamese also uses the **12-hour format**, with sáng/chiều(tối) indicator.
No AM/PM notation is used. 
Time zones may appear in formal contexts but should only be included if present in the source.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45
- 5:50 chiều

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use colons to separate time units.
- Do not use AM/PM.
- Always write hours and minutes with two digits (e.g., 09:00).
- Include time zone only if explicitly present.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
