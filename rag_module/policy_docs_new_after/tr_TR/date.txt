[Date Format]

Definition:  
Turkish dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **after the full date**, with no comma.  
Dots (`.`) are used in short formats.

Examples:  
- 28 Temmuz 2025 Pazartesi  
- 28 Temmuz 2025  
- 28 Tem 2025  
- 28.07.25

Evaluation Criteria:
- Confirm date is in Day → Month → Year order.
- If a weekday is present, place it after the full date.
- Accept both long and short month forms.
- **Do not generate weekdays unless they appear in the source.**

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
