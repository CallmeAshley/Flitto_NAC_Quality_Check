[Locale: tr-TR]

[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Turkish follows continental European numeric formatting:
- A **comma (`,`)** is used to represent decimal points.
- A **dot (`.`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.
- No grouping is used after the decimal point.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56  
- 123.456.789,00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a dot (`.`) for digit grouping in the integer part.
- Use a comma (`,`) for decimal points.
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal.
- No space should appear between digits and separators.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Turkish lira (₺), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Turkish conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
₺, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
TRY, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not rewrite it as a **name** (`400 Amerikan doları`) or **code** (`400 USD`).  
The same applies in reverse. Always preserve the representation type from the source.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
Turkish dates follow the **Day → Month → Year** order.  
If a weekday is present, it appears **after the full date**, with no comma.  
Dots (`.`) are used in short formats.

Examples:  
- 28 Temmuz 2025 Pazartesi  
- 28 Temmuz 2025  
- 28 Tem 2025  
- 28.07.25

Evaluation Criteria:
- Confirm date is in Day → Month → Year order.
- If a weekday is present, place it after the full date.
- Accept both long and short month forms.
- **Do not generate weekdays unless they appear in the source.**

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Turkish uses the **24-hour clock**, with colons (`:`) separating time units.  
No AM/PM notation is used.  
Time zones (e.g., TRT, “Türkiye Saati”) should not be included unless explicitly stated in the source.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use 24-hour format.
- Use colons for separation.
- Exclude time zone unless explicitly in source.
- Always write hours and minutes with two digits (e.g., 09:00, not 9:0).
