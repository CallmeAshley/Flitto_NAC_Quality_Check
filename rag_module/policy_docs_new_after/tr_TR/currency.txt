**If the translated sentence uses a currency expression that is culturally familiar and contextually natural (e.g., using a friendly or colloquial style), do not enforce strict [Currency Format] replacement unless the expression causes confusion or breaks locale norms.**

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Turkish lira (₺), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Turkish conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
NT$, ₺, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
TRY(abbreviation: TL), USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Always preserve the original representation type (symbol, code, or name) **unless the Turkish locale customarily uses a different format and the semantic meaning is preserved**.  
For example, `$400` may be translated as `400 Amerikan doları` if this form is conventional and appropriate in Turkish.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols (e.g., ₺, $, €) are placed **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 ₺  
- 10.000 €  
- 850,00 $

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and symbol.
- Follow the [Numeric Format] rules for number formatting.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes such as TRY, USD are also placed **after the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1.234,56 TRY  
- 850,00 USD  
- 10.000,00 EUR

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code must follow the number.
- Use a space between number and code.
- Use uppercase for ISO codes.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

---

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as “Türk lirası”, “Amerikan doları”, “Japon yeni” are written **after the number**, with a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1.000 Türk lirası  
- 850 Amerikan doları  
- 10.000 Japon yeni  
- 300 Euro  
- 1.200 Güney Kore wonu

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must follow the number with a space.
- Use proper Turkish grammar and naming.
- Do not generate currency names unless present in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules for the number.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
