If the translated sentence uses a colloquial or emotionally expressive tone (e.g., social media style, casual speech), do not forcibly replace natural time expressions like 'between 1 and 2 AM' with strict [Time Format] such as '01:00 and 02:00', unless clarity is compromised.

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Turkish uses the **24-hour clock**, with colons (`:`) separating time units.  
No AM/PM notation is used.  
If the translated sentence includes a time zone (e.g., PT, PST, GMT, UTC), revise the sentence to reflect it appropriately in the target locale.

Examples:  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use 24-hour format.
- Use colons for separation.
- Always write hours and minutes with two digits (e.g., 09:00, not 9:0).

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
