[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the currency is not Thai baht (฿), the original representation format — **symbol**, **code**, or **name** — must be preserved in the translation.  
Only **positioning and spacing** should be adapted according to Thai conventions.

Expected currency symbols include:  
NT$, ฿, $, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
THB, USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, KRW, CNY, INR, RUB, TRY(abbreviation: TL), AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Always preserve the original representation type (symbol, code, or name) **unless the Thai locale customarily uses a different format and the intended meaning is preserved**.  
For example, `$400` may be translated as `400ดอลลาร์` if this representation is natural and conventional in Thai.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
Currency symbols such as ฿, $, €, etc. are placed **before the number**, without any space.

Examples:  
- ฿1,234.56  
- $1,000.00  
- €10,000.00  
- ¥8,000

Evaluation Criteria:
- Symbol must appear immediately before the number.
- No space between symbol and number.
- Follow [Numeric Format] for the number.

---

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes (e.g., THB, USD) are placed **after the number**, separated by a **space**.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56 THB  
- 850.00 USD  
- 10,000.00 EUR

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use a space between number and code.
- Use uppercase letters for currency codes.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

---

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names like “บาท” (baht), “ดอลลาร์” (dollar), or “เยน” (yen) appear **after the number**, without any space.

Examples:  
- 1,000บาท  
- 850ดอลลาร์  
- 10,000เยน  
- 300ยูโร  
- 1,200วอน

Evaluation Criteria:
- Currency name must directly follow the number with **no space**.
- Use correct Thai currency term.
- Do not generate currency names unless present in the source.
- Follow [Numeric Format] rules.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
