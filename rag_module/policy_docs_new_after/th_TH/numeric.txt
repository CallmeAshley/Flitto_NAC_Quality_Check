[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
Thai follows Western-style formatting by default using Latin numerals, though native Thai digits may be used in formal or traditional contexts.

- A **dot (`.`)** is used for decimal points.
- A **comma (`,`)** is used every three digits in the integer part for grouping.
- Thai digits (e.g., ๑, ๒, ๓) are not the default and should be ignored unless explicitly present.

Examples:  
- 1,234.56  
- 123,456,789.00

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use Latin numerals by default.
- Use commas in the integer part and a dot for the decimal point.
- Do not apply grouping after the decimal.
- Thai numerals should be accepted only when explicitly required in the source.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
