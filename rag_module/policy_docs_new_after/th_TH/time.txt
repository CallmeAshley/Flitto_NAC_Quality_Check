[Time Format]

Definition:  
Thai uses the **24-hour clock**.  
- In formal formats: use Thai unit words such as “นาฬิกา” (hour), “นาที” (minute), “วินาที” (second).
- In short formats: use colons (`:`) to separate time units.
- Time zone names or “เวลาในประเทศไทย” are only included if explicitly mentioned.

Examples:  
- 14 นาฬิกา 30 นาที 45 วินาที  
- 14:30  
- 14:30:45

Evaluation Criteria:
- Use 24-hour time.
- Accept both word-based and colon-separated formats.
- Do not use AM/PM.
- Only include time zones if present in the original.
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
