[Time Format]

Definition:  
Korean uses both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats depending on the context.

Examples:  
- Spoken or casual use: 오전 9시 30분, 오후 2시  
- Digital or scheduled use: 09:30, 14:00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- In 12-hour format, include 오전 (AM) or 오후 (PM) **before** the hour.  
- In 24-hour format, use colons (`:`) and **always use two digits**, including leading zeros (e.g., 09:30, 14:00).  
- Do not include time zone information (e.g., KST) unless explicitly required by the original.  
[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
