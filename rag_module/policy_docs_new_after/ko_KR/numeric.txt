[Number Format]

Note:  
While the following rules provide strict formatting guidelines, LLMs must prioritize semantic consistency and contextual appropriateness.  
If the translated sentence's format clearly matches the source meaning and local convention, **do not penalize minor structural variations**.

Thousands are separated by a comma (`,`).  
Examples: 1,000; 1,000,000  
Decimals are written using a period (`.`).  
Example: 3.14

- If the number is expressed using language-specific unit words (e.g., “million,” “billion,” “thousand,” or their equivalents in the target language), **do not convert it to fully numeric form with separators**.  

- Abbreviation units such as "k" or "m" in the source sentence must be translated into a form that is natural and customary in the target language. For example, "3k" should be translated as "3,000" or the equivalent written form such as "3천," depending on the conventions of the target locale.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses or postal codes
  - identification codes (e.g., product IDs, part numbers, serial numbers)
  - software or hardware error codes
  - clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- Do not apply formatting to numbers followed or preceded by a label or symbol (e.g., "113026 - Relay", "Part No. 113026").

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the source sentence before making changes.
