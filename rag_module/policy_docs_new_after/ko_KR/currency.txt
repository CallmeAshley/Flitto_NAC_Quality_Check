[Currency Format]

Note:  
While the following rules provide strict formatting guidelines, LLMs must prioritize semantic consistency and contextual appropriateness.  
If the translated sentence's format clearly matches the source meaning and local convention, **do not penalize minor structural variations**.

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the symbol or code is not for the Korean won (₩), the original currency **must be preserved** in the translation. Only its **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Korean formatting rules.

Expected currency symbols include:  
$, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
USD, EUR, KRW, JPY, CNY, GBP, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a currency **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not convert it into a currency **name** (e.g., `400달러`) or **code** (e.g., `USD 400`).  
The same rule applies in reverse for codes and names.  

Always preserve the currency representation type (symbol, code, or name) used in the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
In Korean, all currency symbols — including ₩, $, €, ¥, etc. — must be placed **before the number** with **no space**.

Examples:  
- ₩12,345.00  
- $12,345.00  
- €1,000.00  
- ¥8,000  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency symbol must appear **before the number**.  
- There must be **no space** between the symbol and the number.  
- This rule applies to all currency symbols, not only ₩.  
- Follow the formatting rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- The original symbol must be preserved from the source text.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes like KRW, USD, or EUR appear **before** the number, followed by a **space**.

Example:  
- KRW 12,345.00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The code appears before the number.  
- Use a space between the code and the number.  
- The number format must follow the rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- The currency code from the source must be preserved.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as 원 (won), 엔 (yen), 위안 (yuan), 달러 (dollar), 유로 (euro), and 파운드 (pound) are often used in natural Korean text instead of symbols or codes.  
These should be attached directly after the number, with no space.

Examples:  
- 30,000원  
- 10,000엔  
- 100위안  
- 300달러
- 100유로  
- 50파운드

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must follow the number with **no space**.  
- The name must match the actual currency being referenced.  
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- LLM must correctly localize currency names when they appear in natural language.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
