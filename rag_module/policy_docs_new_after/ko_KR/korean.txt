[Locale: ko-KR]

[Numeric Format]

Definition:  
In Korean, numbers follow Western-style formatting:  
- Use a comma (`,`) every three digits in the integer part of the number.  
- Use a dot (`.`) as the decimal separator.  
- Do not insert commas after the decimal point.  

Examples:  
- 1,000  
- 12,345.67  
- Invalid: 12,345.678,900  
- Invalid: 1000 (missing thousand separator)  
- Invalid: 1.000,25 (wrong decimal separator)  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Commas are used only in the integer part.  
- Decimal points must be written using a dot (`.`).  
- No space should appear between digits and separators.  
- Do not use commas in decimal places.  
- Accept numbers with any decimal precision if separators are applied correctly.

[Currency Format]

Shared Principle for Currency Symbols and Codes:  
LLMs must handle a wide variety of currency symbols and ISO codes in translations.  
Even if the symbol or code is not for the Korean won (₩), the original currency **must be preserved** in the translation. Only its **position and spacing** should be adapted according to Korean formatting rules.

Expected currency symbols include:  
$, ¢, €, ¥, £, ₩, ₹, ₽, ₺, ฿, ₱, ₡, ₨, ₦, ₫, ₭, ₲, ₵, ₿, ¤, ƒ, ₮, ₪, ₴, ﷼, ₸, ₾

Expected ISO currency codes include:  
USD, EUR, KRW, JPY, CNY, GBP, INR, RUB, TRY, AUD, CAD, CHF, MXN, BRL, PLN, SEK, NOK, DKK, CZK, HUF, ILS, SAR, AED, SGD, HKD, TWD, THB, MYR, IDR, PHP, VND, ZAR, UAH, NZD

Important:  
Do not convert between currency formats.  
If the source uses a currency **symbol** (e.g., `$400`), preserve the **symbol** in the translation.  
Do not convert it into a currency **name** (e.g., `400달러`) or **code** (e.g., `USD 400`).  
The same rule applies in reverse for codes and names.  

Always preserve the currency representation type (symbol, code, or name) used in the source.

1. Currency Symbol Format

Definition:  
In Korean, all currency symbols — including ₩, $, €, ¥, etc. — must be placed **before the number** with **no space**.

Examples:  
- ₩12,345.00  
- $12,345.00  
- €1,000.00  
- ¥8,000  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency symbol must appear **before the number**.  
- There must be **no space** between the symbol and the number.  
- This rule applies to all currency symbols, not only ₩.  
- Follow the formatting rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- The original symbol must be preserved from the source text.

2. Currency Code Format

Definition:  
Currency codes like KRW, USD, or EUR appear **before** the number, followed by a **space**.

Example:  
- KRW 12,345.00

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The code appears before the number.  
- Use a space between the code and the number.  
- The number format must follow the rules defined in the [Numeric Format] section.  
- The currency code from the source must be preserved.

3. Currency Name Format

Definition:  
Currency names such as 원 (won), 엔 (yen), 위안 (yuan), 달러 (dollar), 유로 (euro), and 파운드 (pound) are often used in natural Korean text instead of symbols or codes.  
These should be attached directly after the number, with no space.

Examples:  
- 30,000원  
- 10,000엔  
- 100위안  
- 300달러
- 100유로  
- 50파운드

Evaluation Criteria:  
- The currency name must follow the number with **no space**.  
- The name must match the actual currency being referenced.  
- Number formatting must follow the [Numeric Format] rules.  
- LLM must correctly localize currency names when they appear in natural language.

[Date Format]

Definition:  
- Dates in Korean follow the order **Year → Month → Day (연 → 월 → 일)**.  
- This format does not use slashes (/) or dashes (-). It uses Korean suffixes like `년`, `월`, `일`.  
- Alternatively, dates may be written using dots (`.`) as separators.  

Weekday Position and Rule:  
- If a weekday is included in source sentence, it must appear **after the date** in translated sentence, separated by a space.  
- If the source text **does not include** a weekday, the translation must **not add one**.

Examples:  
- 2025년 7월 28일 월요일  
- 2025년 7월 28일
- 7월 28일 월요일
- 7월 28일  
- 2025. 7. 28. 월요일
- 2025. 7. 28  
- 7. 28. 월요일
- 7. 28  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm the date order is Year → Month → Day when all components are present.  
- If a weekday is present in the source sentence, it must be placed after the date and **separated by a space**.  
- Weekdays must not be added if not present in the source sentence.

[Time Format]

Definition:  
Korean uses both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats depending on the context.

Examples:  
- Spoken or casual use: 오전 9시 30분, 오후 2시  
- Digital or scheduled use: 09:30, 14:00  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- In 12-hour format, include 오전 (AM) or 오후 (PM) **before** the hour.  
- In 24-hour format, use colons (`:`) and **always use two digits**, including leading zeros (e.g., 09:30, 14:00).  
- Do not include time zone information (e.g., KST) unless explicitly required by the original.
