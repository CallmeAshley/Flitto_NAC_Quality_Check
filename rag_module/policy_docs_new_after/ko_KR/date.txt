[Date Format]

Note:  
While the following rules provide strict formatting guidelines, LLMs must prioritize semantic consistency and contextual appropriateness.  
If the translated sentence's format clearly matches the source meaning and local convention, **do not penalize minor structural variations**.
  
In Korean, dates are typically written in the order of year + month + day.  
Examples: 2023년 10월 22일 화요일, 1990년 1월 1일, 5월 3일, 9/27, 2025. 03. 22, 2025/2/10
Including the weekday is optional.
Including the year is optional.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
