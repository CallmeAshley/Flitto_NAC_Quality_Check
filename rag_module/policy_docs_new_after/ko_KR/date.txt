[Date Format]

Definition:  
- Dates in Korean follow the order **Year → Month → Day (연 → 월 → 일)**.  
- This format does not use slashes (/) or dashes (-). It uses Korean suffixes like `년`, `월`, `일`.  
- Alternatively, dates may be written using dots (`.`) as separators.  

Weekday Position and Rule:  
- If a weekday is included, it must appear **after the date**, separated by a space.  
- If the source text **does not include** a weekday, the translation must **not add one**.

Examples:  
- 2025년 7월 28일 월요일  
- 7월 28일 월요일  
- 2025. 7. 28. 월요일  
- 7. 28. 월요일  

Evaluation Criteria:  
- Confirm the date order is Year → Month → Day when all components are present.  
- If a weekday is present in the source, it must be placed after the date and **separated by a space**.  
- Weekdays must not be added if not present in the original.

[Exceptions]

- Do not apply the formatting rules to numbers that are part of:
  - telephone numbers
  - addresses
  - identification codes
  - or clearly unordered lists of numbers with no separators

- If the numbers or formats (e.g., 10:00, 12/31, $15) appear to be part of such non-linguistic constructs based on the sentence context, do not apply localization guidelines.

- Always consider the context of the original sentence before making changes.
