[Date Format]  
In Italian, dates are generally written in the order of "weekday + day + month + year."  
Example: lunedì 22 ottobre 2023  
Both weekdays and month names are written in lowercase.
Including the weekday is optional.

[Time Format]  
Italian commonly uses the 24-hour clock system.  
Hours and minutes can be separated using either a colon (`:`) or a period (`.`).  
Examples: 14:30, 14.30

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated using a period (`.`).  
Examples: 1.000, 1.000.000

Decimals are written using a comma (`,`) instead of a dot (`.`).  
Example: 3,14

[Currency Format]  
Currency symbols such as the euro (€), pound (£), and dollar ($) are placed after the number, with a space in between.  
Examples: 1.200 €, 950 $

Currency symbols do not appear before the number.

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
