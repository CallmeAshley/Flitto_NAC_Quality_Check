[Date Format]  
In Turkish, dates are generally written in the order of "weekday + day + month + year."  
Examples: pazartesi 22 Ekim 2023, 22 Ekim 2023  
When used in the middle of a sentence, weekday and month names are written in lowercase.
Including the weekday is optional.

[Time Format]  
Turkish typically uses the 24-hour clock system.  
Examples: 14:30, 09:00

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated by a period (`.`).  
Examples: 1.000, 1.000.000

Decimal points are written using a comma (`,`) instead of a dot (`.`).  
Example: 3,14

[Currency Format]  
The Turkish lira (₺) can be placed either before or after the number, and both forms are generally accepted.  
Examples: ₺1.200 or 1.200₺

Currency symbols other than the lira (₺) are placed before the number, usually without a space.  
Examples: €1.200, $950

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
