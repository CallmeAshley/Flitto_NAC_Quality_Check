[Date Format]  
In Portuguese, dates are generally written in the order of "weekday + day + month + year."  
Examples: 22 de outubro de 2023, segunda-feira 22 de outubro de 2023  
The preposition "de" is used before both the month and the year.  
Weekdays and month names are written in lowercase.
Including the weekday is optional.  

[Time Format]  
In Portugal, the 24-hour clock system is commonly used.  
Example: 14:30

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated by a period (`.`).  
Examples: 1.000, 1.000.000

Decimals are written using a comma (`,`) instead of a dot (`.`).  
Example: 3,14

[Currency Format]  
Currency symbols such as the euro (€), pound (£), dollar ($), and Brazilian real (R$) are placed **before** the number.  
Examples: €1.200, $950, R$35,00

There is usually no space between the currency symbol and the number.

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
