[Date Format]  
In Ukrainian, dates are generally written in the order of "weekday + day + month + year."  
Examples: понеділок 22 жовтня 2023, 22 жовтня 2023  
Including the weekday is optional.

[Time Format]  
Ukrainian commonly uses the 24-hour clock system.  
There are no AM/PM indicators; the hour value alone indicates the time.  
Examples: 14:30, 9:00

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated by a space.  
Examples: 10 000, 1 000 000

Decimal points are written using a comma (`,`) instead of a dot (`.`).  
Example: 3,14

[Currency Format]  
Currency symbols such as the euro (€), pound (£), hryvnia (₴), and dollar ($) are placed **after** the number, separated by a space.  
Examples: 1 200 ₴, 950 €

Currency symbols never appear before the number and are always placed after it.

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
