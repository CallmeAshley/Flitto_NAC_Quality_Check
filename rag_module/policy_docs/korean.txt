[Date Format]  
In Korean, dates are typically written in the order of year + month + day.  
Examples: 2023년 10월 22일 화요일, 1990년 1월 1일
Including the weekday is optional.

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated by a comma (`,`).  
Examples: 1,000; 1,000,000  
Decimals are written using a period (`.`).  
Example: 3.14

[Currency Format]  
Currency symbols are placed **before** the number.  
Examples: ₩1,200; $1,000; €500

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
