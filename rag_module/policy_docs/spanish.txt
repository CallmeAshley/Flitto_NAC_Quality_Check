[Date Format]  
In Spanish, dates are generally written in the order of "weekday + day + month + year."  
Example: lunes 22 de octubre de 2023  
Both weekdays and month names are written in lowercase.  
The preposition "de" is used before both the month and the year.
Including the weekday is optional.

[Time Format]  
Spanish commonly uses the 24-hour clock system.  
However, the 12-hour clock format (with AM/PM) is also acceptable in casual or conversational contexts.  
Examples: 14:30 or 2:30 p. m.

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated by a period (`.`).  
Examples: 1.000, 1.000.000

Decimals are written using a comma (`,`) instead of a dot (`.`).  
Example: 3,14

[Currency Format]  
Currency symbols such as the euro (€), pound (£), and dollar ($) are placed before the number.  
Examples: €1.200, $950

There is usually no space between the currency symbol and the number.

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
