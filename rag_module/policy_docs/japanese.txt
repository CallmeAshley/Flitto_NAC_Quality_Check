[Date Format]  
In Japanese, dates are typically written in the order of "year + month + day."  
Example: 2023年10月22日  
Kanji characters for year (`年`), month (`月`), and day (`日`) must be included after the corresponding numbers.

[Time Format]  
Japanese uses both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.

In the 12-hour format:  
- "AM" is written as `午前`  
- "PM" is written as `午後`  
Examples: 午前9時, 午後3時

In the 24-hour format:  
- The hour is followed by `時`, and minutes are optionally indicated with `分`.  
Example: 14時30分

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated by a comma (`,`).  
Examples: 1,000 / 1,000,000

Decimal points are written using a dot (`.`).  
Example: 3.14

[Currency Format]  
The Japanese yen (円) is placed **after** the number.  
Example: 1,200円

Currency symbols other than yen (円) are placed **before** the number.  
Examples: $950, €1,200

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
