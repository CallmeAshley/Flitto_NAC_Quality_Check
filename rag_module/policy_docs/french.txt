[Date Format]
In French, dates are generally written in the order of "weekday + day + month + year."
Sometimes the weekday is included, and sometimes it is omitted.  
Examples: mardi 22 octobre 2023, 22 octobre 2023

Both weekdays and month names are written in lowercase.

[Time Format]
French typically uses the 24-hour clock system.
Hours and minutes are written using an "h" between the hour and minute values.
Examples: 14h30, 9h00

[Number Format]
Thousands are separated by a space instead of a comma.
Examples: 1 000, 1 000 000

Decimals use a comma (`,`) instead of a dot (`.`).
Example: 1 003,14

[Currency Format]
Currency symbols such as the euro (€), dollar ($), and pound (£) are placed **after** the number, separated by a space.
Examples: 1 200 €, 950 $

Currency symbols never appear before the number.

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
