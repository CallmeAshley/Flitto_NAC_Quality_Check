[Date Format]  
In Indonesian, dates are typically written in the order "day + month + year."  
Example: 22 Oktober 2023  
The first letters of weekday and month names are capitalized.  
Weekdays are optional and placed before the date.  
Example: Senin, 22 Oktober 2023

[Time Format]  
Both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats are used in Indonesian.

For the 12-hour format:  
- Morning hours use **pagi**  
- Afternoon and evening hours are expressed based on time range:  
  - **siang**: 12:00 to 15:00 (early afternoon)  
  - **sore**: 15:00 to 18:00 (late afternoon)  
  - **malam**: after 18:00 (evening/night)

In the 24-hour format, a period (`.`) is used to separate hours and minutes.  
Examples: 14.30, 09.00

[Number Format]  
Thousands are separated by a period (`.`).  
Examples: 1.000, 1.000.000

Decimals are marked with a comma (`,`).  
Example: 3,14

[Currency Format]  
The Indonesian Rupiah is written as **Rp** immediately before the number, with no space.  
Example: Rp120.000

Other currency symbols like the dollar ($) and euro (€) are also placed before the number, typically with no space.  
Examples: $950, €1.200

Distinguish between currency units (e.g., won, 円) and currency symbols (e.g., ₩, ¥, $), and evaluate only the currency symbols.
