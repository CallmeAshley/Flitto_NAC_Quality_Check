    "trans": "1. [redacted_name] will send the fourth homework via email today (Tuesday 8/10); Parents, please print it out for your children to work on.\n2. [redacted_name] uses Vietnamese to request the children to do the exercises, so it is my hope that parents explain the requests of the exercises so that the children understand to do them; and also explain so that they can memorize as well as be able to apply the knowledge next time.\n3. [redacted_name] will also attach Grammar exercises, please print them out so that the children could review them.\nParents, please check your spam, junk mail box if you still do not receive it by this afternoon. The children only study from 2 to 2.5 hours of Vietnamese weekly, so it is challenging for them. VD is aware that they are extremely busy but it is my hope that parents assist the children to spend around two 30-minute sessions a week to review and do Vietnamese homework. Only by having complete comprehension, they can remember, and later on, their Vietnamese can be reserved. I expect your cooperation. ü•∞"
