I’m talking to you... look at me\nGofen turns and says: Huh... what did you say\nGofen laughs at her appearance and says: What is this? Hahaha, you made me laugh\nNeslihan hits Gofen on the shoulder and says: Don’t laugh... How do I look\nHe looks at her from top to bottom and says: Without it, you look much better (naughty, he means before she put it on 😂)\nNeslihan is surprised but quickly understands, sits beside him, and doesn't look at her reflection in the room's mirror\nShe hits him hard on the chest and says: Were you looking at me from here, you perverted eye? Honestly, that’s shameful... Really, shame on you\nGofen: who? me? I didn’t look... What are you saying ... No, no, I swear I didn’t\nNeslihan: Liar... This is why you were lost in thought while I was talking to you\nGofen scratches the back of his neck, lowers his head to the ground, and says: I didn’t expect the four to do this!\nNeslihan pushes him again and says: Shut up... Shut up... Ugh, I’m so embarrassed\nNeslihan covers her face with her hand and says: Go on, leave\nGofen: Are you serious? You want me to leave you here and go?????!\nNeslihan: Yes, go back to your house... This has become my home, if you haven’t forgotten"
