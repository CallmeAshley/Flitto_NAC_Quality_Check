If I couldn't get it, I would have cried T\nMore food trucks and Suwon fans than I thought lol lol What time on earth are you all coming..? I heard that Chicken Skewers and Chicken Kangjeong were delicious, but I found out too late, right,,,? 🥲\nAfter listening to the opinions of people who said they were frustrated because the data did not work during the last weekday game, and exchanged it into a paper in advance ✔️\nIn the end, it's Starbucks that comes to Gimpo and eats lol\nI heard Salter's bathroom was so bad that I prayed a hundred times in my heart not to have a stomachache please🙏\nWhen I was about to go after going to the restroom, I heard someone said there was a line for entry. lol I rushed over in a hurry, but until where is the line 💬?\nIt seems to stand in a line for entry for about 15-minute, right,,,? It took 55 minutes to barely complete to get in. lol It's a marvelous phenomenon that the entrance time is always the same whether you come early or late.\nI have no regrets about this love 💙🤍❤️ Let’s go up, Suwon.\nVariable seat means this,,? It's like a tunnel\nFortunately, I didn’t feel much shaking,,,!\nAside from Banda Book, the Republic of Korea where no one will steal your personal luggage even if you throw it on the floor like this is the best. Really! 💖\nI definitely made a reservation thinking it was a passage, but there was an passage, but the entrance was only on the other side,,, I went to a seat in a panic status and the seat I reserved was in the center of the small group,,, ,,, I was very embarrassed, but they let me change my seat, so I moved to the end of the small group. It's a win-win each other\nThe big flag is so great ,,, Great ,,,\nFlutter ~ I felt like I was part of a small group experience group (?)  lol"
