    "text": "「…殺す。 絶対殺す」\n「ハイハイ。 I love youね」\n呆れたように肩をすくめながら、カイザーが突然両手をパッと離す。 満足したからもういい、とでも言いたいのだろう。 まるでおもちゃに飽きた子供じゃないか。\n勝手に誘き寄せて好き勝手遊んで飽きたらポイ。\nその身勝手な行動に、何かがブチっと切れた。\nあぁ、コイツは本当に俺をムカつかせる天才だ。",
    "trans": "\"...I'll kill you. I'll definitely kill you.\"\n\"Yes, yes. I love you.\"\nKaiser shrugged with a look of exasperation, then suddenly released both hands with a quick motion. It was as if he wanted to say, 'I'm satisfied now, so I'm done.\" He looked just like a child who had grown bored of a toy.\nHe lured me in on his own, played around as he pleased, and then tossed me aside when he got bored.\nSomething inside me snapped at his selfish behavior.\nAh, this guy really is a genius at pissing me off."
