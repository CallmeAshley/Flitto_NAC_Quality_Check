    "trans": "He loves school, and although he's been absent from school due to illness before, he's never said he doesn't want to go, so as his parent, I'm puzzled.\nYesterday, he seems to have been hurt by how he was the only one who was made to apologize after Kazuki-kun had told on him to Yukari-sensei, even though it was Kazuki-kun's attitude that was the problem. He didn't even know why Kazuki-kun had become angry."
