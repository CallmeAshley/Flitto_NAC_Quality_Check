    "trans": "When I arrived home, I carefully inserted the key into the keyhole, carefully turned it, carefully opened the door, carefully stepped inside, and carefully closed it. Whispering \"carefully, carefully\" to myself, I took off my shoes and walked down the corridor.\nThe house was very quiet. Rin is the type who cares about immersion, so she is probably playing her game with headphones on."
