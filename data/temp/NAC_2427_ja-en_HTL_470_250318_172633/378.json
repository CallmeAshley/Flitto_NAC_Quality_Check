    "trans": "Covering his mouth with his hand, he inhaled the smoke and exhaled it in a thin stream toward some distant direction. Tsukasa did not particularly like the sweet aroma. He recalled the taste of the previous brand with stronger menthol, though he could not remember the name, and as he was about to return the lone cigarette, he noticed that his sister's eyes were drawn upward, captivated by the rising white smoke."
