However, the facility is spacious, with not only the indoor amenities but also 3 outdoor sauna booths that can be reserved for private use by guests. The outdoor air bath certainly feels amazing, and the outdoor water bath is said to be chilled with mountain water. By the way, I always use the cheaper indoor option since the outdoor one is pricey. Most people go for the outdoor saunas, and many of them come on weekends. Therefore, weekday evening are almost like having the place to yourself."
