    "trans": "I suppose the beauty or ugliness of one's face still has an impact even after death.\nHearing the excited voices saying they wouldn't mind dying if it meant they could meet such a handsome ghost, I feel a little sad, reflecting on my own mediocre existence.\nBut, well, it doesn't concern me, does it?\nIf it were a beauty like a certain famous actress, he'd want to catch a glimpse of her, but meeting this handsome ghost would bring no particular benefit to Yuujin.\nWhen I heard this rumor, I never thought that the mystery that I wrote off as having nothing to do with me would come to me itself."
