    "trans": "I buried myself nose-deep into the fluffy bed and perked up my ears.\n\"Good night, Ms. Illumi.\"\nMs. Opera had escorted me to my room and said those words a long time ago, just like always. Just as usual, the lights were turned off, the fluffy slippers were taken off, and I lay down in the middle of the big bed. Normally, as soon as I did that, my eyelids would grow heavy in an instant, and before I knew it, it would be morning. That is how my nights usually go.\nBut tonight is different.\nI inhaled the scent of the blanket that was pressed against the lower half of my face and stared intently at the ceiling."
