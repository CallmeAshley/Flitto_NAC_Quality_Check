For instance, if it were shown to kids at a preschool, it would undoubtedly become a huge topic of conversation. And with that level of technical skill and creative presentation, Rui wouldn't need to focus solely on AI robots-he'd surely be valued even in a regular theater troupe.\n\"...So, why are you working as a host?\""
