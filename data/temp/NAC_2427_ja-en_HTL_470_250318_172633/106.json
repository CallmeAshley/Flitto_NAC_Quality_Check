    "trans": "Unlike his brother, he falls into the category of being conventionally good-looking, which only made his behavior all the more problematic.\nWhen he rescues someone from a thug and gently takes her thin, bruised hand and offers her words of comfort, any innocent girl would instantly fall for him.\nThe girl in front of him blushed, her cheeks turning red with embarrassment, while he, oblivious to her reaction, checked the condition of her bruised arm. \"Insensitive fool,\" Momoko muttered to herself.\nHe probably did not have any ulterior motives, but his actions were bound to be misunderstood."
