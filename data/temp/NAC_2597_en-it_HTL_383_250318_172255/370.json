His body simply dissipating into a black smoke from where it crossed him, only to regenerate back into a copy of hee husband right after.\nThat moment she realised she couldn't beat whatever that creature was, but aje was willing to die trying.\n....\nWei Ying stood their crying silently as he waited, but no one left those dark clouds for a long time, the only thing giving him hope were the occasional bright lights of a sword glare.\nThe sun had began to set, and the kid had now sat down, eyes too dry to cry, body shivering slightly from the cold and he hiccuped as an after effect to his earlier breakdown.\nHe hadn't seen any light in a while, he still was where his mother left him, not any closer not any further. But he felt uneasy not being able to see or hear anything, especially with the incoming dark of the night.",
