    "text": "Five brand-new polls show me narrowly LEADING Republican Senator Deb Fischer here in Nebraska. But with less than 30hours until our most important fundraising deadline of the entire campaign so far, we’re falling dangerously short of our goal and what we need to defeat Republican Deb Fischer and win this Senate seat.\nThat’s why – for only the second time ever – a group of donors is TRIPLING all gifts to help us hit our goal, fight back against Mitch McConnell’s Super PAC attacks, and win this Senate seat!\nI don’t know when, or if, we’ll have another rare matching opportunity like this again. That’s why it’s so crucial that you take full advantage of this rare chance for every dollar you give to go THREE TIMES as far toward helping me win this Senate seat.",
