    "text": "\"Ahh iya Sunghoon, aku akan tidur sama kamu, ini hari spesial kita kan?\"\nSunghoon mendengar itu hanya tersenyum, lucu sekali melihat Jay yang ketakutan begitu. Sunghoon melepas bekapan Jay kemudian mengecup telapak tangan nya.\n\"Bagus, teruslah menurut Jay, aku suka melihatnya.\"\nJay ingin marah tapi ia tidak berani, terlalu bahaya karena sekarang kartu AS berada di tangan Sunghoon dan Jake, Jay jadi mual entah kenapa jika ia tak sengaja mengingat kejadian semalam, matanya berpendar seakan mencari sesuatu yang bisa mengatasi mualnya, dan ketika ia melihat Heeseung masuk kedalam ruangan Jay langsung saja menghampiri Heeseung kemudian sengaja menabrakan tubuh nya ke dada Heeseung seakan tengah mengajak Heeseung bercanda.\n\"Yak Jay jangan mendorongku, aku malas memperbaiki rambutku lagi!\"",
    "trans": "\"Ahh right, Sunghoon, I’m going to sleep with you. It’s our special day, right?\"\nSunghoon heard this and just smiled, finding it amusing to see Jay looking so scared. He released his hold on Jay and kissed the palm of his hand.\n\"Good, keep it up, Jay. I like seeing this side of you.\"\nJay wanted to be angry but didn't dare to. It was too risky since the ace card was now in the hands of Sunghoon and Jake. Jay felt nauseous for some reason when he accidentally remembered what happened the night before. His eyes darted around as if searching for something to ease his queasiness. When he saw Heeseung walk into the room, Jay quickly approached him, intentionally bumping his body against Heeseung's chest as if he were inviting him to play.\n\"Hey, Jay, don’t push me! I don’t want to fix my hair again!\""
