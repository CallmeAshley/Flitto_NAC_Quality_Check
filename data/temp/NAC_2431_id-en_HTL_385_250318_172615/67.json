She mentioned that when they were together, she was also aware that she was pregnant at the time, emphasizing that this wasn’t entirely Bjorn’s responsibility.\nThen, Erna also said, “I love you,” and they both returned to Schuber together.\nSoon after, the news spread everywhere. People would realize that Bjorn truly loved Erna and was completely devoted to her. They commented, “The prince loves his wife,” and “He’s madly crazy about his wife,” which was pretty amusing.\nSo far, I’m really satisfied with the ending~ I appreciate that Erna isn’t quick to forgive Bjorn, and I’m also pleased with the efforts he made to win her back."
