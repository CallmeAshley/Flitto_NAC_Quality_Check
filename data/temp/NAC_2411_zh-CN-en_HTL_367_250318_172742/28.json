    "trans": "The moment the tiger's mouth pinched the back of his neck, Hu Xia felt numb, half awake and half immersed in this huge affair. With his hands tied and pressed against the wall, and saying such provocative words, Hu Xia must have known that he would inevitably be beaten up by Brother Fu, but didn't he want to achieve this situation on purpose? Didn't he just want Brother Fu to do these things to him? Hu Xia held his breath and waited. He always asked the older person for something, and he also waited for Fu Xinbo to ask him for something.\n\"Ha... my stomach is hot.\""
