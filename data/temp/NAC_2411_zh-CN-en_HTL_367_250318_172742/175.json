    "trans": "2. The conflict between economic development and environmental protection: In the pursuit of economic growth, the protection of the environment for the species to survive is often neglected. For example, large-scale development and construction projects may destroy the habitats of wild animals, leading to a decrease in the species.\n3. Insufficient international cooperation: Species conservation is a global issue that requires close cooperation among countries. However, there are still many obstacles in this field, such as unequal distribution of benefits and political differences."
