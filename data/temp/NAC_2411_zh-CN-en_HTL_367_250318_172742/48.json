    "trans": "Seeing Hikoko's neck being firmly gripped by the demon-like senior, feeling the increasingly intense pressure coming from Hikoko, and worst of all, having the quail eggs used up as projectiles. I had no choice but to surrender.\n【\"Sister Koto, I was wrong. I… I need to use the restroom.\"】 The situation was out of my control, so I had no other choice. Surely, the world would understand my plight.\nTsukinoki Koto was finally satisfied. She loosened her grip on Hikoko's throat slightly, but it was only to send it back into the lion’s den once more.\nSpitting it out in there? That didn’t seem quite right. But… what could I do? This wasn’t a problem I could solve."
