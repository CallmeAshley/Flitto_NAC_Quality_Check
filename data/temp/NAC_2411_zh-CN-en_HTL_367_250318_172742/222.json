Let's go and persuade Uncle San?\"\nXu Chiyuan: \"Uncle San usually loves our cousin sister so much, but he suddenly kicked her out of the house. Is it to deal with the stockholders? He shouldn't scold her, right?\"\nAlmost as soon as he finished speaking, Master Xu San's face turned black: \"What's wrong with you?\"\nHis tone was very bad."
