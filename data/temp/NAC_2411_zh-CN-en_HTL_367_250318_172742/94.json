    "trans": "Itoshi Sae, at the age of 28, announced his retirement in the summer.\nThe crowd was roaring, with some screaming and some crying, but only Itoshi Sae stood stiffly in place, trembling all over, staring at the pale figure on the field.\nYou’ve left me behind and betrayed me again.\nThe man with bean-colored hair always seemed to take it lightly, bidding farewell to the field amidst the tears of the fans in the stands.\nHe smiled and waved to everyone as if he had no regret and they could all meet again at the next match."
