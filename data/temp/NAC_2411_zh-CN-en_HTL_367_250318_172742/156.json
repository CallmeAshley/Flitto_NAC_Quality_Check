    "trans": "Following his father’s orders, he hid himself among the fox people, guarding against any potential dangers. His mother was accompanied by a few personal guards from the Cloud Riders as she visited the fox people who had just been rescued. From a distance, she spotted him and clearly recognized him, but her gaze flicked away as if shocked by electricity. Hulie’s ears drooped. He didn’t approach her any further, instead watching from afar as his mother spoke softly with the leader of the fox people, bandaged the wounds of the injured, and distributed pills to protect them from the effects of wolfbane. He saw her check the pulse of a fox person lying lifeless on a stretcher, shake her head, and gently close the dimmed eyes with her five fingers. Nearby, a young fox cub sobbed quietly, and his mother soothed him in a soft voice before leaning down to hold him in her arms."
