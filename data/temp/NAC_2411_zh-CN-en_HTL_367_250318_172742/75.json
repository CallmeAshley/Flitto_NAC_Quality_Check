    "trans": "Within the tavern, the smell of stale wood and cold, wet mould burst into people's nostrils. In the wooden wine glasses, the fragrant fresh beer ale glowed brightly in the dim light. However, the salted fish on the table stank, the bran broth was too salty to swallow, and the grease and grime on the tabletop made people cringe in disgust.\nIn recent days, the tavern was far less lively than it used to be. A few people drank and ate in silence with the occasional sound of the lady boss driving away the vagrants at the door.\n\"Has someone else been missing lately?\" Suddenly, someone lowered his voice and spoke.\n\"Yes... The hunter who... lives in the north of the city is rumoured to have been missing for a week.\""
