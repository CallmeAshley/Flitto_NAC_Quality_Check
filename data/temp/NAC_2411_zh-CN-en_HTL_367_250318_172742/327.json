    "text": "TrendForce集邦咨询指出，NVIDIA对Blackwell系列芯片的划分更细致，以分别提供符合CSP(大型云端业者)效能要求和服务器OEM性价比需求的产品，并根据供应链所能提供的量能动态调整。 如B300A锁定OEM客群，预计待H200出货高峰过去，于2025年第二季起才会逐步放量。",
    "trans": "TrendForce points out that NVIDIA has made a more refined segmentation of its Blackwell series chips, offering products tailored to meet the performance requirements of CSPs (large cloud service providers) and the cost-performance needs of server OEMs, with adjustments based on the supply chain's capacity. For example, the B300A targets OEM customers, and it is expected that it will gradually ramp up shipments starting in the second quarter of 2025, after the peak shipment of the H200 has passed."
