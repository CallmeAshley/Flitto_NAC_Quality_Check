    "trans": "When the wolf realized the rabbit was gone, it began searching frantically. Upon seeing the rabbit run into the bush, it immediately gave chase. The rabbit dodged left and right in the thicket, using the dense cover as protection to successfully evade the wolf’s pursuit.\nThe little rabbit ran all the way home and shut the door behind it, still trembling with fear. From that day on, it became much more cautious, always paying extra attention to its surroundings whenever it ventured out to avoid encountering the wolf again. As for the wolf, though it failed to catch the rabbit this time, it didn’t give up and continued prowling the forest for its next opportunity."
