After the Shu campaign, I handed over everything in full—how could I dare to withhold anything?\"\n\"Is that so? Then I’ll take my leave for now.\" Ling Buyi's eyes remained fixed on Wan Songbai, whose own gaze wavered, refusing to meet his. With that, Ling Buyi and his entourage were escorted to the gates by Wan Songbai.\nWan Songbai: \"General Ling, are you sure you won’t stay for a meal?\"\nLiang Qiuqi: \"No need to see us out, General Wan. My young master never dines outside his own residence.\"\nAt that moment, Wan Qiqi was cheerfully returning to the residence, arm-in-arm with Cheng Shaoshang, laughing and chatting along the way.\n\"Greetings, General Ling.\" Upon seeing Ling Buyi, Wan Qiqi and Cheng Shaoshang immediately bowed in respect."
