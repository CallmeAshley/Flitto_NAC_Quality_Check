    "trans": "After getting off the cable car, please follow me and walk slowly. We have now taken the cable car to the Glacier Park Observation Deck at an altitude of 4506 meters. From here, you can walk for about 40 minutes and go through more than 1130 steps to the highest observation deck of the Glacier Park. The altitude there is 4680 meters. As the saying goes, surpass yourself and challenge your limits. If the weather is clear and cloudless, the main peak of our Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, Shan-Tzu-tou, is within reach. It is very spectacular and will make people feel a sense of \"standing on the top of the mountain peak and overlooking all the mountains that seem small\"."
