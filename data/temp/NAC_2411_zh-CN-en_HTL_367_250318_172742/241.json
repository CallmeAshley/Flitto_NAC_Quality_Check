    "trans": "Forced to be born into a single-parent family. Forced to endure his mother marrying his stepfather. Forced to give his stepfather hand relief. Forced to endure domestic violence.Of course, sleeping with Park Chen-cheng wasn’t forced. It was consensual—mutual willingness, with the added benefit of money. But Sun Shiyou had thought during restless nights that this wasn’t what he wanted to do. Sometimes, he would tell himself it was out of necessity: the high cost of medical bills, the terrible family situation. Yet he knew those were just lies to elevate himself onto some moral high ground. Sun Shiyou understood full well that this wasn’t any different from being kept or working as a gigolo."
