    "text": "朱凤莲说，“台独”意味着战争，与台海和平水火不容。 没有一个家长愿意自己的孩子因“台独”被裹挟上战场。 民进党当局蓄意“以武谋独”，强迫台湾青年充当炮灰，是对广大台湾民众特别是台湾青年安全福祉的最大威胁。 只有坚决反对“台独”，台海和平才能得到切实保障，台湾民众才能安心无忧，台湾青年才有更好未来。",
    "trans": "Zhu Fenglian stated that “Taiwan independence” leads to war and is fundamentally incompatible with peace in the Taiwan Strait. No parent wants their children to be dragged into conflict because of the pursuit of “Taiwan independence”. The Democratic Progressive Party authorities' deliberate push for “independence through force”, which forces Taiwan’s youth to serve as cannon fodder, poses the greatest threat to the safety and well-being of the public, especially Taiwan’s young people. Only by resolutely opposing “Taiwan independence” can peace in the Taiwan Strait be safeguarded, the people of Taiwan assured of peace, and the youth of Taiwan given a brighter future."
