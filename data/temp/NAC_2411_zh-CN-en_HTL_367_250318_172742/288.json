    "text": "我们认为，无人驾驶应用可以挽救生命，这一点已得到广泛认可。 据了解，许多的交通事故是由人为错误造成的。 无人驾驶汽车更加保障人们的安全，减少交通事故的发生。\n另一方面，无人驾驶汽车也有很大的风险。 自动驾驶就像是一个机器人，由程序和人工智能芯片控制，所以总是有破坏的风险。\n从我的角度来看，无人驾驶技术还在进步，但如果相关技术的研发能进一步提升，我们相信这项技术在未来可以得到有效的应用。",
    "trans": "We believe it is widely recognized that driverless applications can save lives. As we knew, many traffic accidents are caused by human error. Driverless cars keep people safer and reduce traffic accidents.\nOn the other hand, driverless cars come with great risks. Autonomous driving is like a robot controlled by programs and artificial intelligence chips, therefore the risk of damage is always there.\nFrom my point of view, driverless technology is still improving, but if the research and development of related technology can be further improved, we believe that it will be used effectively in the future."
