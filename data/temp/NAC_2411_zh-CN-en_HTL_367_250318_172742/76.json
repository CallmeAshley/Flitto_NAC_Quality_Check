    "text": "与 RevPAR 的不同之处\nTRevPAR 对您的业务有何益处？\n此外，TRevPAR 可帮助确定特定时间段内收入上涨的原因。 比较不同的群体，确定哪些群体对酒店的收入影响更大，您就可以据此调整战略，在今后瞄准不同的业务。\nTRevPAR 包括酒店所有收入来源，而 RevPAR 只包括每间可售房的客房收入。 某些情况下，RevPAR 最高的酒店可能会在 TRevPAR 上不如其他酒店，因为这些酒店有来自其他部门的收入。",
    "trans": "The Difference with RevPAR\nHow does TRevPAR benefit your businesses?\nAdditionally, TRevPAR can help identify the reasons why revenues have risen over a specific period. By comparing different groups and figuring out which ones have a greater impact on your hotel's revenue, it allows you to adjust your strategy accordingly and target different businesses in the future.\nTRevPAR includes all sources of hotel revenue, while RevPAR includes only room revenue per available room. In some cases, the hotels with the highest RevPAR may not perform as well on TRevPAR as other hotels because they have revenue from other departments."
