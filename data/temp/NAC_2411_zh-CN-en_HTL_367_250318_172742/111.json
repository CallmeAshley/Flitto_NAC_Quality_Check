    "trans": "■ Bit1=1, Bit2=1: fully automatic angle-free self-learning\nAfter power-down and re-power-up, the encoder angle self-learning is automatically performed during the first operation of the lift (including maintenance operation and express operation). After successfully learnt, the system will not learn again before the next power down.\nNotice: Semi-automatic/full-automatic tuning also requires that the motor wiring sequence to be correct. Otherwise, there is a risk of motor operation after learning failure. So it is not recommended to use it for the first time of tuning the motor, and it is not recommended to use it as a substitute for the \"tuning with load\" method."
