This was the home where Gu Yiran had lived for 27 years.\nAfter placing his suitcase down, Zheng saw that Gu had already taken out three incense sticks from the drawer of the living room cabinet and was lighting them with a lighter, holding them in his hands, and bowing respectfully to the three black and white photos placed on the baldachine.\n“I’m back, Dad, Mom, Sister Xiaoxiao.”\nOnce he finished paying his respects, Zheng asked Gu for three incense sticks as well. Looking at Zheng with rich emotion, standing beside him, Gu lit the incense for him.\nFor a moment, the room was so quiet, with only the scent of burning incense mixed with the damp mustiness of the air lingering around their nose."
