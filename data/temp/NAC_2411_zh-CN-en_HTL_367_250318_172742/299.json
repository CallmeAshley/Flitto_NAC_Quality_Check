    "trans": "Jian Xingsui smiled faintly, the emotion in his eyes gradually fading. He entered the room, leaving behind only a soft, \"Whatever.\"\nChapter 3: I’m a Huge Fan of Brother Fu\nAfter Jian Xingyue returned to his room, he sat down on the edge of the bed to rest.\nAs he leaned back, he accidentally brushed against his wound. Rolling up his sleeve, he saw the scratch that still stung a little. It was the result of being shoved and falling, though of course, it wasn't An Ran herself who pushed him. It was the security guard patrolling the corner who had done it.\nEveryone says An Ran is kind and innocent, but Jian Xingyue didn’t see it that way. He believed she had deliberately provoked him, timing her words to manipulate him and relying on the security guard’s presence to take advantage of the situation."
