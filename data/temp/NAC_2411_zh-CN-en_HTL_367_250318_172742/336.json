    "text": "在这个巨大、黑暗的地下空洞中，基里曼看到安格隆高高站在自己身旁，俯瞰着他。 他满是污血和伤疤的脸被依然腾起的火焰所照亮，其上带着一种狂野的、基里曼未曾见过的表情。 他踢开了压住基里曼统御之手拳套的石块，但那更像是对石头本身的存在感到不耐烦，而不是想要试图帮助基里曼脱身。 他歪着头继续看着基里曼。\n“你是谁？” 他问。\n哦，不。 意识还有些模糊的基里曼这样想。 那钉子。 那钉子剥夺了安格隆的情感、思考、理性，现在开始侵蚀他的记忆了，他连我是谁都想不起来了。",
    "trans": "In this huge, dark burrow, Guilliman saw Angron standing beside him and looking down at him. His bloodstained and scarred face was illuminated by the burning flame with a wild expression that Guilliman had never seen before. He kicked away the stone that was pressing against Guilliman's Hand of Domination glove. But it was more like he was impatient with the stone itself, instead of trying to get Guilliman out. He tilted his head and kept looking at Guilliman.\n\"Who are you?\" he asked.\nOh, no. Guilliman thought semiconsciously. That nail. That nail deprived Angron of his feelings, thoughts, and reason, and now began to erase his memory. He couldn't even remember who I was."
