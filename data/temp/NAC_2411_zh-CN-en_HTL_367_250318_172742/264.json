    "trans": "Yi Zhongyuan, Chairman of the Global Service Center for Quitting the CCP, remarked, \"July 1 marks the CCP’s founding day, a date that has brought immense suffering to the Chinese people and the nation as a whole. That’s why we’ve designated this day as Global Quit the CCP Day—to remind our compatriots to abandon the CCP and its Marxist-Leninist ideology, and to return to being upright and virtuous as sons and daughters of China. To date, more than 430 million Chinese people have quit the CCP and its affiliated organizations. Even within mainland China, an increasing number of individuals are bravely standing up against the CCP’s tyranny.\""
