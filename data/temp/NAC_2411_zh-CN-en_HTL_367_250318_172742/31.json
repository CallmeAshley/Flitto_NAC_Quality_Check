    "trans": "The little bird spread her arms obediently, tickling Laurentina's heart. She drenched Eleni's body with the shower, and her long fingers brushed against her firm yet supple waist and tender breasts. The bird grunted something and then whispered in her ear in an extremely ambiguous position as Laurentina touched her backside, “Laurentina... Laurentina, how could there be someone as beautiful as you?”"
