My wife has no complaints about me.\"\nNie Yusheng had to use all his strength to suppress the impulse to punch Sun Zhijun in the face. He didn’t want to say any more, only adding, \"Then you persuade Tan Jing. We’ve met all her demands. She doesn’t want the child, and I’ve agreed to give her one million. Please, ask her to give up custody.\"\n\"What? One million?\" Sun Zhijun seemed confused. After a long pause, he sneered, \"Nie, you’re being too stingy. You think one million can buy the child? We’ve put so much effort into raising this child, and you think a million is enough? Who cares about that?\""
