    "trans": "Herrscher of Sentience muttered, wrathfully increasing the frequency of his finger thrusts. The sudden onslaught of pleasure immediately made Fuhua subconsciously clench her legs, and her knees trembled and pressed together. Fu Hua's body tensed up, trying to fight the pleasure, but the more she focused her attention towards her femur, the more limp and weak it became. Soon Fu Hua couldn't take a single step, and had to wrap her arms around Herrscher of Sentience's neck to shift her weight over to keep her balance. Only moments ago she was still resisting, but now she was already deeply trapped."
