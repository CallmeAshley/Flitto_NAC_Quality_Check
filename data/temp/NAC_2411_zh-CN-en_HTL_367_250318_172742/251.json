    "trans": "Atthaphan laughed, seemingly delighted. He stood up and patted Jumpol's head, \"Let's go, the master will take you for a pee.\"\nEntering the bathroom, Atthaphan stopped by the door. Seeing that Atthaphan didn't mean to go out, Jumpol looked up at him in confusion. Is he going to watch me pee?\nAtthaphan grinned and pointed to the corner of the shower, \"Hey, the doggie toilet is over there.\"\nKnowing that Atthaphan must have come up with another way to torture himself, Jumpol had no choice but to obey and climb over."
