    "text": "伊利亚抱得很紧，像是要把这两年以来积攒的怀念全都倾注在这个拥抱里。\n“谢谢你，伊利亚。” 米沙闭上眼睛，他觉得有什么东西正要夺眶而出，“也恭喜你。”\n“没什么，米沙。” 伊利亚闭着眼睛笑了，他拍拍米沙的背，“你一直都做得很好，你要做的只是相信你自己。”\n和伊利亚拥抱在一起的瞬间，米沙恍然间回到了两年前的塔林，平行时空中的塔林。",
    "trans": "Ilya hugged him tightly, as if pouring all the accumulated longing of the past two years into this one embrace.\n\"Thank you, Ilya.\" Misha closed his eyes, feeling something welling up, ready to overflow. \"And congratulations.\"\n\"It’s nothing, Misha,\" Ilya replied with a soft smile, his eyes closed. He patted Misha's back. \"You've always done well. All you need to do is believe in yourself.\"\nIn that moment of holding Ilya close, Misha was suddenly transported back to Tallinn two years ago, to a parallel version of Tallinn."
