    "trans": "......\nOkay.\nAs if he had done the same thing countless times before, the young man agreed to the subconscious in his brain and stopped paying attention to the things he was curious about.\n... Fei Yue had to work overtime tonight, so the couple's room and bed naturally became a little cold. He could only use his own body temperature called \"loneliness\" to gradually warm the bed.\nAlthough he didn't want his pregnant wife to still devote herself to work, this was one of the few requests Fei Yue made to him, so he agreed."
