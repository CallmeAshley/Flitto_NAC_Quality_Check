    "text": "2023年夏天，美国之音记者首次和蒂姆·亨特联系时，他因为担心将案件公之于众会违背道恩的意愿，且过于高调反而不利于道恩在中国的处境而对实名接受采访有所顾忌。 今年8月，美国之音记者对他进行电话采访时，他表示道恩的案件还未有媒体报道过。 他告诉记者，随着他确定在听证会中做证，陆陆续续开始有媒体对他和父亲吉恩(Gene)进行采访，也开始有政府官员对道恩的情况表示关注。",
    "trans": "In the summer of 2023, when Voice of America journalists first contacted Tim Hunter, who was concerned that publicizing the case might go against Dawn’s wishes and that drawing too much attention could negatively impact her situation in China. By August of this year, during a phone interview with Voice of America, Tim noted that no media outlets had reported on Dawn’s case. He shared that as he prepared to testify at the hearings, media outlets gradually began reaching out to interview him and his father, Gene. Additionally, government officials started showing interest in Dawn’s case."
