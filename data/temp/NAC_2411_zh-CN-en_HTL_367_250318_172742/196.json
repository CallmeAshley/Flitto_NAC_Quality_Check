    "text": "你摇摇头，“没有。” 说是吵架，实际上是你单方面的逃避。 没有办法，你现在一看到沈星回就想到那天他极具倾略性的样子，还有从你口中发出的那些连你听了都耳热的声音。\n沈星回第二天就发现你在躲他，也大概知道是什么原因。 起初他打算让你自己降降温，便顺着你的意不去找你。 可对你来说，越是回避，那天的记忆就越是清晰。\n周五的晚上，在过了整整一周时间后，沈星回终于还是不愿再等了。",
    "trans": "You shook your head, \"No.\" Although it was called an argument, in reality, it was your one-sided avoidance. There was no way around it. Whenever you saw Shen Xinghui, you couldn't help but think of the way he looked that day, so full of aggression, and the sounds that came from your mouth, which even made you feel embarrassed just hearing them.\nThe next day, Shen Xinghui noticed you were avoiding him and probably knew the reason. At first, he planned to let you cool down on your own and refrained from looking for you as you preferred. But for you, the more you avoided him, the clearer the memory of that day became.\nOn Friday night, after a whole week had passed, Shen Xinghui finally couldn't wait any longer."
