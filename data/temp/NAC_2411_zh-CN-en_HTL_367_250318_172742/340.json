    "trans": "At that time, his five senses were open.  Every word of hers got into his head and rooted in his heart.\nHis frozen heart was melted by the warmth that was squeezed in.\nFrom that day on, the snake-beastman thought that for the first time, he was loved.\nThe feeling was the same as when he was embraced by an beastman that year when he was very young.\nThe first time he was accepted. The first time he was loved. The first time he held expectations.\nAs it turned out...\nTurned out, it hadn't made a difference.\nHe half-lowered his eyes, and anyone could see how depressed he was.\nWang's eyes wavered Si Yan's figure. She was lying on the silver fur. Her face was sweaty, and her expression was painful."
