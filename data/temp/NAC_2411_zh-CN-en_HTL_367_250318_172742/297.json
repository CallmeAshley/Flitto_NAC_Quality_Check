    "text": "我觉得自己很幸运，能有这么大的勇气去做一次如此奇怪的尝试，然后我才能遇见了你。 想要什么，你就会是什么，我仅仅想要陪伴，你便给予了我我从未体验过的家人、朋友、恋人的一切，你包容我全部的任性和放肆，从不计较和嫌弃。 这一生被折磨了一辈子，还好在这段时间有你，你是我的救赎。\n好啦，怕你太笨了，我再用你最喜欢的直白话跟你说一遍上面这些话的意思。",
    "trans": "I feel so lucky to have had the courage to make such a strange attempt, hence meeting you. Whatever I want, you are exactly that. I simply want companionship, and you give me everything of a family, friend, and lover that I have never experienced before. You embrace all of my willfulness and recklessness and never care or resent me. I have been suffering all my life, but thankfully I have you during this time, you are my savior.\nOkay, in case you're too much of a dork, I'll tell you again what these words above mean in your favorite straightforward words."
