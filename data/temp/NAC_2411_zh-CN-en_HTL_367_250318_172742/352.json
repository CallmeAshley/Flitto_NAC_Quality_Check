    "trans": "Their QQ chat also slowed down significantly. The conversations now mainly revolve around the use of Silver Wu in actual battles on the Starry Sky Chain or how handsome Huang Shaotian looks today—though, of course, the latter is just Blue River’s one-sided commentary.\nEver since Su Mucheng took over as captain and the team gradually matured, Ye Xiu has rarely accompanied the team in person. However, just a few days before Blue Rain’s home match against Xingxin, Huang Shaotian sent him a long string of trash talk.\nIn summary, the content was something like, “Long time no see, Old Ye! Are you scared to play against Xingxin this weekend? Are you coming to the match? Really, it’s been too long since we’ve seen each other!”"
