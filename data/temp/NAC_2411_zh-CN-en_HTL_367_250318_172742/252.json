    "trans": "He seemed to have sensed the breath of his kind, and both of these innate spirit flames were extraordinarily exuberant.\nHowever, the flames only flew around them a few times, without choosing them.\nInstead, they slammed into his pubic region.\nAfter a moment of the burning sensation, Chu Xuan looked inward into his pubic region and suddenly realized that this flame had actually flown into the dormant seed of the World-Destroying Calamity Flame.\nThis seed had always existed within his pubic region. He had used all sorts of methods, but had never been able to rekindle it.\nSeeing it, he couldn't help but expect something.\nCould it be that...\nA moment later.\nHe saw that a bright fire line actually appeared on that ash-like dormant seed."
