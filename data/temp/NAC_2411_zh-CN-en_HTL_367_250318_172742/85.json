    "trans": "\"No, I'm not trying to rebel against mother... I want to be a good kid. I'll listen to you from now on... I'll obey whatever you say... Mum, don't cry... I'll be a good girl...\"  When Zhendong saw her mother like this, all the immorality and fear had long been thrown away. She only knew that the most important thing she should do was not to let her mother down.\n\"Zhendong, will you really listen to me from now on?\" Her mother wiped her tears and continued to fix her gaze at Zhendong."
