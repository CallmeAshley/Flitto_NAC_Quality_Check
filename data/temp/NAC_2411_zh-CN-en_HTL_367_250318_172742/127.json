    "text": "Patrick心想你总会找到更上瘾的事，因为人总需要对什么东西上瘾才能活下去，同时他意识到自己确实已经好些时间没操逼了。 但最终他什么也没说，就算说了对方肯定不会信，况且也没有必须要说服Bryce的理由。\n他走了几步，又回头对Bryce说，别那样叫我了。\n晚上回家后和Evelyn通了会电话，她想明天中午一起吃顿饭。 Patrick突然很想对她说，你能和我一起是因为我同事太忙了，他明天要去打网球。",
    "trans": "Patrick thought that you would always find something more addictive, because one always needs to be addicted to something to live. At the same time, he realised that he really hadn't had sex for some time. But in the end, he didn't say anything, even if he did the guy certainly wouldn't believe him. Besides there was no reason why he had to convince Bryce.\nHe took a few steps. Then he turned back to Bryce and said, Don't call me like that.\nWhen he got home in the evening, he talked to Evelyn on the phone, and she wanted to have dinner with him at noon tomorrow. Patrick suddenly wanted to say to her that you can be with me because my colleague got too busy and he was going to play tennis tomorrow."
