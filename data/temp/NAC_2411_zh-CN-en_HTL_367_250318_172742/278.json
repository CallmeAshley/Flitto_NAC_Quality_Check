    "text": "因为死神杀死虚，只是让虚的灵魂净化，然后继续轮回，而灭却师却是彻底杀死虚，杀一个少一个，但死神世界里人与灵魂的数量是平衡的，灭却师会打破平衡，使世界灭亡。\n解释：\n因为灭却师和死神有着本质上的区别。 首先，死神是从自己的体内通过修炼不断的提升着自己的灵压，而灭却师却是直接从外界摄取灵力。 这样也就造成了，除了极个别拥有极高天赋的死神之外，其他大部分的死神的实力提升比灭却师要慢上很多。",
    "trans": "When a Shinigami (Soul Reaper) kills a Hollow, it purifies the Hollow’s soul, allowing it to continue the cycle of reincarnation. However, when a Quincy kills a Hollow, it completely destroys the soul, permanently eliminating it. This difference disrupts the balance of souls between the human world and the spirit world, which is necessary to maintain the stability of the universe. If the balance is broken, it could lead to the destruction of the world.\nExplanation:\nThe fundamental difference between Quincies and Shinigami lies in how they derive and use their powers. Shinigami cultivate spiritual pressure (reiatsu) from within themselves through training, while Quincies draw spiritual energy directly from their surroundings. As a result, with the exception of a few exceptionally gifted Shinigami, most Shinigami experience slower growth in strength compared to Quincies."
