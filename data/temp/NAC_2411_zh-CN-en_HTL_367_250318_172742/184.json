    "trans": "Ling Buyi stared straight ahead, using the corner of his eye to steal glances at Se Se. Perhaps the peach blossoms were too vivid, for they seemed to cast their rosy hue upon her face as well, as though spring itself had kissed her cheeks. It was the kind of fleeting spring radiance that could stir anyone’s heart. She tilted her head slightly, appearing to gaze at the blossoms too. A petal brushed against her face, feather-light, like a gentle kiss left behind on her cheek.\nLing Buyi lowered his gaze, taking in the way Se Se avoided his eyes. He turned his head instead to watch He Su practicing swordsmanship nearby. The sword moved with the wind, slicing beneath the peach tree, scattering petals in its wake. The blossoms fell in a graceful flurry, landing softly on her body."
