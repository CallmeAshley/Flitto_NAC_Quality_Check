The importance of teams and groups in the company's quality management\nA small improvement in teams and groups leads to a great promotion of quality and efficiency.\nImprovement background: The inner plate of the back door is stacked tightly without gaps. Every time when picking up a piece, the employee needs to separate the inner plate by hand before taking it out. Due to the heavy canvas gloves,\neach time it takes a long time to take out the inner plate, which causes a bottleneck in the work team, and the use of the test piece to separate the inner plate may cause improper operation and lead to the risk of scratches to the quality of the inner plate."
