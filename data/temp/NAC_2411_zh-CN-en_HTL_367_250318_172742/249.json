    "trans": "Changes in the natural environment may also have certain impacts on cultural erosion. For example, natural disasters and environmental pollution may destroy the living environment and material basis of traditional culture, thereby accelerating the process of cultural erosion.\nIn conclusion, the causes of cultural erosion are various, ranging from the shock and influence of the external environment to the constraints and limitations of internal factors. In order to effectively deal with the phenomenon of cultural erosion, we need to take measures at multiple levels to reinforce the protection and development of traditional culture."
