During Shen Shi, hang around at Wen Meng and you can exit\nHome (Home encounters are completed in the old house)\nThe hardworking angler. I came out at about 8:20 in the morning, and it has nothing to do with the game time.\nDrinking tea is also done in the morning. 7:30-9:30 are good, and wear elegant clothes (I'm wearing the Phoenix set) and keep drinking it at every bench outside. You can get up and change it right after you sit down.\nAlpine Flow: I got it around 17:00. It's not a big deal.\nAchievements are basically better to get when someone comes out the first time. For the rest, please refer to the picture below and good luck!"
