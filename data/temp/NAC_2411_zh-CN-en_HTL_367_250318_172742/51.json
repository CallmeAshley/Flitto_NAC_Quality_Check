    "trans": "Everything about Park Dae-hyun felt so unusual. This strange sensation swept over Han Wang-ho like a tidal wave. He was deeply agitated but couldn’t show it, so he feigned nonchalance. \"If you poured me a glass of milk at night, I might even call you considerate.\"\n\"It’s pointless,\" Park Dae-hyun said with certainty. \"You can’t sleep well when I’m around.\"\nHe wasn’t wrong about that.\nSomeone used to being alone for so long would naturally find it hard to adjust to having an adult man lying next to them. Even though they had just finished an intense, passionate encounter, Han Wang-ho still felt the urge to send him to the guest room.\n\"Enjoying a bed all to yourself is a wonderful thing, don’t you think?\" Han Wang-ho thought his reasoning was perfectly sound."
