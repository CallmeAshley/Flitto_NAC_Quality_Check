    "trans": "The school authorities issued clarification statements on all their social media accounts, warning those spreading rumors and defamation.\nThe teachers at the Network Management Center investigated further and discovered that neither the account that originally posted the video nor the devices used by informants were connected to the campus network.\nThe academic advisor scheduled a meeting with Bai Mengqi, then sent a message in the grade-wide group chat, calling for class monitors to attend a meeting. The goal was to identify any students who had doubts and to resolve the matter within the school rather than escalate it online.\nAfter calming down, Bai Mengqi also posted a clarification video and text statement on the platforms where the discussion was gaining the most traction.\nShe didn’t have the money to pay for marketing or promotion, and even if she did, she wouldn’t spend it on this.\nThe innocent will remain innocent—those who view the world through tinted lenses are probably beyond convincing."
