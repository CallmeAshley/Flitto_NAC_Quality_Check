Isn’t that a form of arrogance?\nThe automatic doors of the convenience store slowly closed, and I signed when looking at the extra oden I had bought in the plastic bag in my hand.\nThe chilly north wind howled, and the lonely shadow of the streetlight stood on the tarmac.\nCompared to the bustling Tokyo, in a remote small town the nights always came earlier."
