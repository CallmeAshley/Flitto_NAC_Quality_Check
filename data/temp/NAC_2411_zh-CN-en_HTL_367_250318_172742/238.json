    "trans": "After the game, he stood watching the all-too-familiar gestures on the field. Guardiola’s favorite thing to do: pulling every player into a warm hug, kissing their cheeks, leaning close to their ears, and whispering something that always made them laugh. Then Messi saw Guardiola embracing Rodri. The player’s height, slightly taller than the coach, allowed Guardiola to bury his head directly into the crook of Rodri’s arm during the hug. Rodri naturally wrapped an arm around Guardiola’s shoulder, leaning down and shielding his ear with a hand as the coach whispered something. Whatever it was, it must have been amusing, as they exchanged a smile. From behind them, Haaland approached, stepping closer to Guardiola’s other side. He reached out to wrap an arm around the coach’s waist, who was looking at him with a grin."
