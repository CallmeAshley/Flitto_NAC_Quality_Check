    "text": "我们一共在南京玩了三天，但是南京好玩的地方真的太多了，我们的时间太少了。 要是以后有时间的话，我还要去南京玩。 10月6日我们坐高铁回到了上海。\n如果你也想去南京玩，我给你推荐中山陵和夫子庙，这两个地方都很漂亮。 要是你喜欢美食，我推荐你尝尝南京的盐水鸭，又好吃又便宜。 最后给大家推荐一个很棒的软件——大众点评。 出去玩的话，这个软件非常有用。",
    "trans": "We spent three days in Nanjing, but there were so many interesting places in Nanjing and we had so little time. If I have time in the future, I will go to Nanjing again. On October 6, we took the high-speed rail back to Shanghai.\nIf you also want to go to Nanjing, I recommend Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Fuzimiao, both of which are very beautiful. If you like food, I recommend you try Nanjing salted duck, which is delicious and cheap. Finally, I recommend a great software to everyone - Dianping. This software is very useful when you go out to play."
