    "trans": "[redacted_name]\nIn the past, for English learning, I focused more on reading and writing, and to avoid my child following the same wrong path, I’ve placed special emphasis on developing my child’s listening and speaking skills. However, while the intention was clear, implementation was so challenging. Thanks to iFlytek's ets100, a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. It offers a wealth of content, including synchronized exercises that keep pace with the teacher’s lessons, helping my child to consolidate knowledge promptly and not fall behind; there are also full-simulation listening and speaking quizzes from past exam papers, which have been a great help in exam preparation (my child’s scores have been improved noticeably in the mid-term exams). What reassures me the most is the intelligent instant scoring feature of ets100: my child can receive accurate scoring and effective feedback for every exercise, contributing to significant progress. It’s truly a joy to see that! I’m glad to share this great resource with more parents who are exerting a lot of effort in this regard!"
