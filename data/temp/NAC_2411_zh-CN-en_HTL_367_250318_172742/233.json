    "trans": "As for your mention of education and well-being again, your actions contradict your predetermined intentions regarding her education and well-being. So, what is the point of bringing it up again?\nOn the contrary, I am very willing to discuss her education and well-being with you, as this represents the best education and well-being for her current childhood development stage. However, if you are unwilling or reluctant to do so, that’s not my problem. I recall you once said that traveling is the best form of education in your opinion. Traveling accompanied by both parents is indeed the best positive form of education.\nBut if it involves traveling with various female companions of yours, it can only bring her negative influences.\nIf such travel lacks educational value and is merely about sightseeing, then she can travel and enjoy the scenery herself when she grows up."
