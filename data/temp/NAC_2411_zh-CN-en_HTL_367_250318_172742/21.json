    "trans": "You suddenly get the idea to *defile* her.\nYou wrapped your arms directly around Jingliu's waist. It's very soft, like a slender slender emerald willow.\n「Pupil?」\nJingliu's tone did not fluctuate much. She had already known of your arrival.\nA gust of cold air was born on your arm, intending to penetrate your skin and pierce right through your flesh and bones. Her soft waist became slightly stiff. Obviously, she didn't expect you to come directly up to her.\n「It's cold.」\nYou couldn't help but say it, but instead of letting her go. You tightened your embrace even more. Jingliu's body trembles slightly. She wants to say something to you, but stops just short of saying it. You can't see exactly how she looks under the blindfold."
