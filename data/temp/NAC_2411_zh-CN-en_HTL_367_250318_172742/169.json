    "trans": "Before entering the temple, visitors can see a tall pillar in front of the entrance, known as the “Everlasting Dharma Brahma Pillar.” The front of the pillar is inscribed with the four large characters “Everlasting Dharma,” while the back features the entirety of the Diamond Sutra handwritten by Su Shi. At the top of the pillar is a gold-plated four-faced lion design, modeled after Emperor Ashoka’s pillar at the Deer Park in northern India.\nUpon entering the temple, visitors are greeted by a large square courtyard in the center of which stands a grand incense burner cast from 15 tons of white bronze. Unlike many other temples where the halls are aligned along a central axis, Jing’an Temple’s arrangement is unique. The halls dedicated to the Bodhisattvas are connected to rooms used by monks for their daily rituals, encircling the courtyard in two levels. Typically, visitors first walk around the courtyard to explore the first floor before ascending to the second."
