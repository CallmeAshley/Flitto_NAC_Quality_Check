    "trans": "Xueya didn't see anyone along the way, which had something to do with him as well. He just met the Imperial Guards and said there was a fire in Ningfu Palace, which caused the Imperial Guards who were assigned to this area to skip their patrolling duty.\nIn the deserted palace, there were only him and the people behind him. Xueya felt that he was doomed to die this time, but who did he offend? Who was determined to kill him again and again?\nHe was clearly acting accordingly to the instructions in the dream.\nLogically, he shouldn't die so early."
