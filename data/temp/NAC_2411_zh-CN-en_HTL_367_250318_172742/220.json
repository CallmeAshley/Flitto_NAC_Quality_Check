    "text": "原来如此!\n一片福地的灵气,是有限的。 修炼时,如果一个人占了一半,后来的人就只能占另一半。 而如果其中一个人占了八成,另一个人就只能占两成。 吸收灵气化为己用的能力越强,能占用的灵气就越多。\n这些神官是在担心,如果他也在这里修炼,会把大半的灵气都占尽。 而剩下的灵气再给他们三十几个人分,每个人就根本都没剩几丝了!",
    "trans": "So that's it!\nThe spiritual energy of a blessed land is limited. During practicing austerities, if one person takes half, the next person can only take the other half. And if one person takes 80%, the other person can only take 20%. The stronger the ability to absorb spiritual energy for one's own use, the more spiritual energy can be occupied.\nThese priests are worried that if he also practice austerities here, he will take up most of the spiritual energy. If the remaining spiritual energy is divided among more than 30 people, each person will have nothing left!"
