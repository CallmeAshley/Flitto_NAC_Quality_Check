For safety, Coslin used a mechanical device to carefully open it, maintaining a distance of over three meters.\nZzzzz...\nAs soon as the lid was lifted, a faint pink mist poured out, looking strange but harmless.\nHahaha~ Hahaha~\nA clown doll with a spring mechanism popped out from the bottom of the box."
