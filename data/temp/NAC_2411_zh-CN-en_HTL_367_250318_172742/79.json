    "text": "密脉轮：顶轮。 发现有的说法认为紫玉晶对应眉心轮，但是通过顶轮对应色是紫色，而且紫色水晶一般都有灵性、神性、直觉等功效，也进一步对应了顶轮的含义。 所以我认为紫玉晶对应的应该是顶轮而非眉心轮。\n22功效：有益于灵性的提升和进行冥想。 缓解精神压力、压抑、焦虑等。\n望适合人群：对灵性、神性课题的兴趣者和学习者，情绪紊乱者，偏头疼或作息失调者。\n！ 注意：紫玉晶从功效层面来分析，其他水晶更适合定期消磁才能更好发挥其原有的功效。",
    "trans": "Dense Chakra: Top Chakra. It was found that some claims suggest that amethyst correspond to the brow chakra, but by the fact that the top chakra corresponds to the colour purple. That purple crystals are generally known to have spiritual, divine, and intuitive effects also further corresponds to the top chakra. Therefore, I believe that the top chakra, not the brow chakra, is the correct colour for the amethyst.\n22Effects: Beneficial for spirituality and for meditation. Relieves mental stress, depression, anxiety, etc.\nSuitable for: people interested in and learning about spiritual and divine subjects, people with emotional disorders, migraines or disordered work and rest.\n! Note: Amethyst are analysed from the level of effect, other crystals are more suitable for regular demagnetisation in order to give better performance to their original effect."
