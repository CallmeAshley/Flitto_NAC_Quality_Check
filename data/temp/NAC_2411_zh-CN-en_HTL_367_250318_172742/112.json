    "trans": "In the ghost stories Grandma used to tell during the long summer nights of power grid overloads, there were several parables about \"extremes beget reversals\" and \"things will inevitably swing back.\" Thinking about the greedy fox made into a scarf, Takemura couldn't shake the feeling that something terrifying was about to happen. A wandering beggar became a general of the king. He didn’t deserve such good fortune and could only pray with all his heart that misfortune would arrive a bit later.\nWith 2 minutes and 15 seconds remaining, Takemura slid open the paper door and walked from the shady logistics eaves corridor toward Saburō’s main house."
