    "trans": "Time flies, and soon it comes to the first month of the fifth year of Jian'an. Luoyang City has been snowing for several days. The snowflakes flying all over the sky are covering the ground like a thick silver carpet.\nToday is a rare sunny day. The sun shines through the clouds and falls on the silver-clad ground, reflecting dazzling rays of light. The snow on the treetops begins to melt, and the dripping water drops draw a beautiful arc in the air and fall on the ground, making a crisp sound.\nIn the pure white garden, the pink plum blossoms are in full bloom, and suddenly a graceful figure with a gorgeous hairpin skirt walks into the picture."
