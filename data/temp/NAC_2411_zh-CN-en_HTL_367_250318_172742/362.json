    "trans": "The warm morning light shone into the turtle's bedroom. The turtle walked into the bathroom as usual and prepared to wash up. At this time, he was surprised to find that his shell had turned into a pair of wings! The turtle immediately rushed out of the house, flew to the monkey, and signed up for the sports meeting.\nNot long after, the forest sports meeting began. The first event was the flying competition. As soon as the starting gun sounded, the turtle flew into the air like an arrow from a string. After several days of hard training, the turtle's flying speed had improved significantly, and it reached the finish line first."
