    "trans": "Two servants immediately pushed the door open and walked in.\nFeng Jiu’er was stunned and wondering he was about to have her driven away?\nDon’t worry, she wouldn’t return to the Feng residence tonight. If she were to be expelled from the Ninth Prince’s mansion, she would go to the back door of the mansion and sleep there.\nShe would go back when it was dawn the next day.\nHer own reputation was quite tarnished, but the Ninth Prince’s was different, which was absolutely sacred and inviolable.\nTherefore, even if the ugly woman was rumored to have spent the night at the Ninth Prince’s mansion, no one would think of any dubious relationship between her and the Ninth Prince.\nAt most, people would think she had just been incredibly lucky to be taken in by the prince."
