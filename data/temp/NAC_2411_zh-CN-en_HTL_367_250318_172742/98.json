    "text": "“对了，队长，昨晚有奇怪的状况发生。”\n克莱恩把昨晚发生的事简单说了一遍。\n他其实没什么线索可以提供，屋内没有钟，也没有窗户，他无法判断事情发生的时间，而隔着一扇特殊处理过的铁门，他也没能看到罪魁祸首的模样。\n至于纸上的内容，属于带有神秘学含义的符号，和隐秘存在的尊名一样，不能随便画出或说出，他只能略略提一句，不敢描述具体细节。",
    "trans": "\"By the way, Captain, something odd happened last night.\"\nKlein gave a brief account of what happened last night.\nHe didn't really have any clues to offer. Because there were no clocks or windows in the house, he couldn't tell when it happened, and he couldn't get a look at the culprit through a specially treated iron door.\nAs for the contents of the paper, they were symbols with occult meanings, and not to be drawn or uttered casually like the honorable names of hidden existences; therefore, he could only mention them briefly, not daring to describe the specific details."
