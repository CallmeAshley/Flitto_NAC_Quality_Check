Nannan!\"\nThe second elder Sister's shout brought Shen Zhinan back to his senses.\n\"What's going on, Sister?\"\nShen Zhinan was somewhat upset. Ever since that day when he witnessed Hua Qianshang expelling Shi Xianzhi from the imperial city, he had been thinking about his relationship with Hua Qianshang almost every day.\nIt would be bullshit to say that the two of them are deeply connected.\nBut it would be complete nonsense to say that the two of them didn't have any feelings at all."
