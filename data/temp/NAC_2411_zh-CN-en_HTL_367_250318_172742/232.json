    "trans": "“Fuyu, I’m here.”\n“I…”\nChunben Shu didn’t hear the words that followed. She buried her face in her chest. She should have made some seductive gestures, but instead, another tear fell, landing in Lin Dongyu's cleavage.\nShe didn’t understand why she felt this way tonight; she just wanted to cry.\nPerhaps they both understood that no matter how intimately they were pressed together, an invisible barrier separated them. Let’s admit it: the five years apart had made them strangers, each nursing their own wounds.\n“Turn to the side and hold me.”\nChunben Yu did as she was told."
