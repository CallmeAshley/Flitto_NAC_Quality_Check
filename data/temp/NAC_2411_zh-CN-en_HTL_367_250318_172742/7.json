    "trans": "But he hadn’t moved at all.\nDid I just encounter a ghost?\nThe figure in the mirror appeared to say something, but no sound reached him.\nFu Jianxue wasn’t frightened. Instead, it was the ghost that seemed unnerved. He needed to finish cleaning before school ended, so he carried on, wiping down the rest of the mirror, turning to clean the stalls, and then sweeping and mopping the floor.\nWhen he paused for a break, he glanced back at the mirror. The ghost was still there, standing in front of it, watching him clean. As soon as it noticed him looking, it started speaking again. Judging by its mouth movements, it seemed to be asking why he wasn’t afraid."
