    "trans": "From 1840 to 1912, the late Qing Dynasty was marked by a policy of isolationism and a self-sufficient agrarian economy. This approach led to increasing\nstagnation and backwardness, while many countries around the world had already begun transformative advancements in productivity through the Industrial Revolution. As machine production replaced manual labor, nations grew increasingly wealthy and militarily powerful. Britain, the most dominant nation during the Industrial Revolution, sought to export its manufactured goods, such as metal products and woolen textiles, to China. However, these efforts met with little success. To force open the Chinese market, Britain began selling opium."
