Located just 15 minutes from Shengjing Mountain, the Zhanghe Tourism Area has become home to a national aviation hub and China’s largest aviation-themed town, Aifeiqi. The area integrates water and land navigation airports, special aircraft manufacturing (including airships), aircraft production, and an aviation museum."
