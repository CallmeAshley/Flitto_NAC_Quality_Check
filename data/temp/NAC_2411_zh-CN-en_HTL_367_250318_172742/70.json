This project is to cooperate with Chen Dayuan's research group from the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to make the genetic analysis of \"human and cow embryos\". The institute fused human somatic cells with bovine oocytes to develop embryos. Li Feng said, \"We've got the blastocysts, and we'll do the analyses. We've got the blastocysts, and we'll do the analyses. That's what Miss Sheng meant, she wanted to prove her results on more than one species, because the reprogramming ability of oocytes varies from one animal to another. It's possible that the cow's would be more likely to succeed. But now they can only do blastocysts and not continue to isolate embryonic stem cells from them. Because the project is finished. There's no more financial support.\""
