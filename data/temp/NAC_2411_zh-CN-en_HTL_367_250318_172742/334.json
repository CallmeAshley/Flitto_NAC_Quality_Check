    "trans": "It turned out that you really thought you were in a simple money affair with him.\nEven worse, Graves went round the house and realised you hadn't taken any of the things he'd bought you.\nHe had just come off the battlefield with powder dust and was looking forward to meeting his adorable puppy to drive away his fatigue.\nWhat awaited him was a tidy, dim, and empty home.\nHe was furious.\nThe Shadows had never seen Graves lose his temper like that before.\nGraves stared at you, whom he had pinned to the door panel. His eyes sharp as a falcon's."
