    "text": "在我们的日常生活中，我们经常看到许多普通人做着平凡的事情。 七一勋章的获得者黄文秀就是一个很好的例子。 作为高材生的她毅然决然的选择帮助贫困乡村，无处不在为乡亲们谋好处，始终将自己投身于工作中，甚至献出了自己的生命。 像这样的人还有刘秀详，他放弃优厚的待遇，回到贫困的大山里当一名普普通通的教师，助力千名贫困学子圆了大学梦，这样的例子数不胜数。 这些人我们甚至可能没有注意到，但他们对我们的生活至关重要。",
    "trans": "In our daily life, we often see many common people doing ordinary things. Huang Wenxiu, the attendee of the July 1 Medal, is a good example. As a high school student, she resolutely chose to help poor villages, to seek benefits for folks in every corner, always devoting herself to her work, and even giving up her life. Liu Xiuxiang, who is the same example, gave up a favorable treatment, returned to the poor mountains as an ordinary teacher, helping thousands of poor students to fulfill their dreams of college. There are numerous examples like this.  We may not even notice them, but they are vital to our lives."
