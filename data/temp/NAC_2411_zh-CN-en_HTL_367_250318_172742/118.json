    "trans": "\"I’m not looking for a boyfriend right now.\" Lin Benchuan said.\nLu Qi raised an eyebrow.\n\"Not looking for a boyfriend, or just not looking for me?\"\nNeither, honestly.\nLu Qi gave Lin Benchuan a once-over, making no effort to hide the disdain in his gaze as it lingered on Lin Benchuan’s scrawny frame. \"I heard that in just two years of high school, the number of people you've dated—guys and girls—could fill an entire movie theater. Don’t tell me you were deeply in love with every one of them first before dating. You don’t strike me as the romantic type.\"\n\"I don’t date little kids.\" Lin Benchuan said, turning his head to avoid Lu Qi’s gaze."
