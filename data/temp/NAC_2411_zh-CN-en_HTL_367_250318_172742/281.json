    "trans": "Tsukuyomi was speechless. How many times have you done this without telling me? How can you say it was your first night? But when a young bird grows up, it will leave the nest. He can no longer control him. Their relationship should have changed a long time ago.\nTsukuyomi's already weak physical strength was not enough to support him to think clearly during the break. He passed out, and then was woken up by being fucked again like before. His throat was a little hot and painful. He saw that they had changed positions. He was sitting in Huang's arms. This position made him go deeper. His lower abdomen was slightly bulging due to the ejaculation, just like he was pregnant, which made him uncomfortable."
