    "trans": "Mobile phones are becoming more and more popular in modern people's lives. Miss Li has been working for less than two years, but she changes her mobile phone every few months. Her current mobile phone is a black Motorola mobile phone, which is very thin and looks very special. The Samsung and Nokia mobile phones she used before were all new models, and they also looked 80% new. Miss Li said: \"I am tired of my old mobile phones.\"\nAlthough the price of new mobile phones is at least 3,000 yuan,\nwhich is equivalent to Miss Li's monthly salary, this does not affect Miss Li's enthusiasm for new mobile phones."
