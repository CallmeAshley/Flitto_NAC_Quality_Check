    "text": "“嗯？ 我是你的肋骨吗？ 就像亚当和夏娃那样？” 我装作生气的样子，右手挣开他的亲吻，双手搭在他的肩膀上。\n“不，你是我的血肉。 所以我们应该重新合为一体。” 他的头埋入我的胸前，柔软的头发使我感觉有点痒。 我摸着他的头发，就像母亲对孩子那样。\n此时我才发现，我把我所有的负面情绪都给了他。\n在学校里，人人都说我是“温柔的万世忍”“无暇女神”——那都是万世忍的伪装。",
    "trans": "\"Hmm? Am I your rib? Like Adam and Eve?\" I pretended to be angry, broke away from his kiss with my right hand, and put my hands on his shoulders.\n\"No, you are my flesh and blood.

I touched his hair like a mother to her child.\nAt this moment, I realized that I gave him all my negative emotions.\nAt school, everyone said that I was \"the gentle Wanshi Ren\" and \"the flawless goddess\" - that was all the disguise of Wanshi Ren."
