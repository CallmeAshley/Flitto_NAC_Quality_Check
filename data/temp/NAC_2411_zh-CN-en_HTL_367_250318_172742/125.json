    "trans": "Dear Tracy,\nSubsidiary customer ICHIBAN is currently overdue for more than 31 days in the amount of 250,000 USD. Universally more than 31 days in the amount of 200,000 USD, the two customers need to apply for overdue self-repayment. Do not report the credit insurance. The reasons are as follows:\n1. According to the feedback from several local customers, the current Indian terminal collection is not good, which leads to the payment delay. In addition, all companies and banks are on holiday this week and next week for Diwali holiday in India, which will slow down the speed of payment;"
