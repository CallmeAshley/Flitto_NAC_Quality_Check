    "trans": "Back at Naib’s apartment, I saw a package at the door. The recipient’s name was his, so I brought it inside. It was heavy, seemingly filled with books.\nSitting on the sofa, I used a fruit knife to open the package. The books weren’t wrapped in bubble wrap; they spilled out loosely. They were just ordinary books, mostly classic literature from home and abroad. As I picked up the ones that had fallen to the ground, my hand suddenly froze mid-air. I had seen a book titled The Minds of Billy Milligan."
