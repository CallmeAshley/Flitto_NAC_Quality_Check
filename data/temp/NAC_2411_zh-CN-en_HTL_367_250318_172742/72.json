For example: \"The annual Double Eleven sale has begun, and the platform is offering many exciting promotions. Click the link in the lower-left corner now to grab a free 2024 yuan Double Eleven subsidy! Everyone has one chance—be quick, or you’ll miss out! Don’t wait, try it now!\"\nFor soft advertising content, such as dramas, film reviews, and similar works, the promotional message should be seamlessly integrated with the content of the creator’s work.
