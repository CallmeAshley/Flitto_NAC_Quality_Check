    "trans": "Lee Sang-hyeok looked at Lee Min-hyung, whose thoughts had finally risen above kindergarten level thanks to the suppressant patch, and mercilessly countered, \"Is it also romantic to use up your suppressants early because you were jealous and entered the heat cycle early, fail to get replacements ahead of time, and then hang off me like a walking complaint machine?\"\nLee Min-hyung seemed tempted to nod but hesitated after glancing at his expression, ultimately just blinking innocently.\n\"You’re really that upset?\" Lee Sang-hyeok asked.\n\"Not too bad, just a little more upset than when someone steals my pentakill,\" Lee Min-hyung described."
