    "text": "所谓的“潮人恐惧症”，就是害怕去哪些高档、新潮的场所，害怕哪些打扮的光鲜亮丽的人，去了这些场所、见了那些比较新潮的人，会突然感觉手无举措，从而紧张害怕。\n可以说，这些反应就跟社恐差不多。 不过，相对于社恐的话，这种只会害怕那些打扮的过于潮流的人，下意识想躲，并且还有点若有若无的尴尬。\n而有up主曾经总结了几个容易出现“潮人恐惧症”的场所：精酿酒馆、咖啡店、理发店。 除此之外，一些著名的网红打卡点和新兴青年社区，也是潮人集中出没的地方。",
    "trans": "The so-called \"fashion anxiety\" is that people have the fear of going to high-class and trendy places, the fear of those who are dressed up in glamorous clothes, and the fear of going to these places and meeting those fashionable people, and suddenly feeling that they have nothing to do with their hands, thus making them nervous and afraid.\nIt can be said that these reactions are similar to the social anxiety disorder. However, compared to the social anxiety disorder, people fear those who dress too trendy, subconsciously want to hide, and also feel a little bit embarrassed.\nAn uploader once summarized a few places that are prone to \"fashion anxiety\": craft breweries, coffee shops and barbershops. In addition, some internet-famous sites and new youth neighborhoods are also places where trend leaders gather."
