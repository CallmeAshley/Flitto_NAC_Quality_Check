    "trans": "On that day, December 1, 2022, I watched his broadcast and saw his handsome face. In that moment, I decided to stay with him forever. This is my promise to Wu Mingxuan. Since then, I’ve been part of the 201 fan group. Even though it’s through a screen, my love for him remains unwavering. He is still my motivation. My mom promised that after my exams, I’ll get to meet him, so I’m working hard to study. Life at school can often feel monotonous and draining, but I keep a small photo of him in my pencil case. Just looking at it instantly gives me the energy to keep going."
