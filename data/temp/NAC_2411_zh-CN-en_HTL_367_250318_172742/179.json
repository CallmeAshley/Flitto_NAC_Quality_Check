    "trans": "She felt her heart beating wildly in her chest. Dealing with cholera all day long, she had long ago gotten used to the idea that it would never come to her. Oh, what a fool she was. She was sure she was going to die and was terrified to the core of her being. The girls brought in a cane bench and set it under the window.\nHowever, she was pregnant, and Katie was so shocked that she warbled from head to toe.\nKatie lay back in her chair again. Something was dead cold inside her."
