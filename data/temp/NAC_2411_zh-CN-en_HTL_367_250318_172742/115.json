    "trans": "Mary, Mary.\nAfter treating his wounds hastily, James twisted a wooden stick and headed out of his rented condo. It was funny, whenever he held it, the cold, rough touch that conveyed his palm was so chilly that it was almost nostalgic. It was just a stick, a stick that had been with him for many days and nights, and stained with dried blood and twisted in shape, yet it was more than that. To James, it was a silent witness through countless struggles, and his closest companion in this endless nightmare. They were almost never separated."
