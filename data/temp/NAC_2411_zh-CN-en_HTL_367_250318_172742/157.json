    "text": "关于你谈恋爱，我和爸爸并没有反对。 但是，真正的爱是互相爱护、帮助、安慰，共同成长，像我和你爸爸一样，而不是互相伤害或者引起伤害，妈妈不希望你陷入这样的关系，特别在你现在才16岁，似懂非懂，又在罹患心理疾病的情况下，这样的恋爱没有帮助到你，只给你带来了伤害，那还要来干什么！\n亲爱的，有时候妈妈觉得你好傻，尽干蠢事，有时候又悔恨自己没有教育好你，没有帮助到你。\n这件事情已经发生了，相信你也会有一点后悔对自己做的事情。",
    "trans": "Regarding your relationship, your father and I do not oppose it. However, true love is about mutual care, support, comfort, and growing together, just like your father and I do. It’s not about hurting each other or causing harm. Mom doesn’t want you to fall into such a relationship, especially since you are only 16 years old, still naive, and dealing with mental health issues. Such a relationship does not help you; it only brings you harm. So why continue with it?\nDear, sometimes Mom thinks you’re so silly, always doing foolish things. At other times, I regret not educating you well enough or not helping you better.\nThis has already happened, and I believe you might also regret what you’ve done to yourself."
