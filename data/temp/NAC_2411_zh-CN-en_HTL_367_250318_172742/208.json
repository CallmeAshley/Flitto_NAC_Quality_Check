His thumb caressed the side of the boy's face, which had a superior contour, with an affectionate and intimate gesture.\n\"My son, you are my irreplaceable possession.\"\nIchigo Kurosaki never understood why Yohabach loved to compare him to an object, just like when he first troubled himself over having a past without a single mark. Yohabach, however, told him that those things didn’t matter. He would fill his future with his present."
