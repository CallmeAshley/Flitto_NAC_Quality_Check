Master Li has instructed that the young ladies are to dine together tonight to get acquainted and foster camaraderie,\" she whispered softly by my side, her tone respectful and humble.\nI nodded slightly in agreement and walked over to sit before the dressing table, letting Yun Zhu’s delicate hands style my hair and apply my makeup.

In less than an hour, Yun Zhu had finished arranging my willow-shaped bun and selected a luxurious dress for me—a luxurious gown of purple silk embroidered with golden threads of diamond patterns, which she draped over my shoulders with care."
