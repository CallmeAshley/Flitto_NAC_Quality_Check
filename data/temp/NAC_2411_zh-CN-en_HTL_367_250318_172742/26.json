    "trans": "Ruan Xi glanced at Yao Ling.\nYao Ling followed her steps and said, \"He went out to look for you.\"\nRuan Xi nodded, making an educated guess.\nPerfect. While he’s not here, she could leave.\nSystem: [Xi Xi really dislikes that black panther, huh? But didn’t you say before that the prickly, spiky one was special and cool? You were enjoying it so much, and now you’re dumping him. Isn’t that a bit too heartless?]\nRuan Xi entered the clinic, speaking slowly: [He’s not someone to mess with, different from Yao Bing or Yao Ling. I don’t like that kind of trouble.]\nThe system quickly understood: [Xi Xi is afraid she can’t get rid of the black panther?]"
