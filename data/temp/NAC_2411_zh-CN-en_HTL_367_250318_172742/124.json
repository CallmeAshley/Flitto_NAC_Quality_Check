    "trans": "Minimum objectives: Both parties set minimum acceptance conditions in the face of market pressures, with labour agreeing to a 7% wage reduction by management. The minimum objective is to ensure that cooperation can be achieved without compromising their own interests. In case of failure to reach agreement on certain terms, both parties should seek other possibilities of cooperation or leave room for future ones.\nThrough the above detailed background introduction, issue analysis and goal setting, we believe that all team members have a clearer understanding and preparation for this negotiation. In the following negotiation process, we will flexibly adjust strategy according to the situation and strive to reach the most favourable agreement for both parties."
