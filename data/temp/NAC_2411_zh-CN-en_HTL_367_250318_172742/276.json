    "trans": "There are four holes for the static contact test in the plant area, which are analyzed as follows:\n1. Number of the static contact test: JT1 Hole depth: 9 meters\nCoordinate: X=260.255 Y=-7.794 Elevation of the hole: 24.986. The surface is swampy, and 1 meter from the mouth to the depth is a silt layer, with highly compressible soil and terrible engineering performance; 1 meter to 2 meters is: topsoil, with heterogeneous soil and poor engineering performance; 3 meters to 8 meters is a silt layer, and 8 meters to 8.5 meters is a sandy soil, with a slightly dense condition and average engineering performance; 8.5 meters to 9 meters is a sandy soil, with a dense condition and low compressibility, featuring good engineering performance."
