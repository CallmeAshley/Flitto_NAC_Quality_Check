    "trans": "●Impressionist music is a new music style that emerged in Paris, the cultural center of Europe, at the end of the 19th century. It is a music genre that emerged under the influence of \"Symbolist literature\" and \"Impressionist painting\". Impressionist music has a completely abstract and transcendent color, and it is the beginning of music entering modernism. Its musical form, texture, expression method, basic aesthetic viewpoint, and the artistic purpose and artistic effect it pursues are very different from classicism and romanticism. It was first created by French composer C. Debussy."
