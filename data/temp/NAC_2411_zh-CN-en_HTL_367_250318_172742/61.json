A reporter asked where Charles and Max were, and George put on a very plastic, official smile and said, \"They're both not feeling well, so they'll be absent from today's press conference. I'm going to take off if you guys have no questions for me.\"\nThe reporters muttered a few words, and the sound of the whispered discussion was like the buzzing of flies, giving George a headache. He rubbed his temples and peeked down at his phone. The dialog box on the screen was a simple sentence from Max, \"Charles and I won't be there.\""
