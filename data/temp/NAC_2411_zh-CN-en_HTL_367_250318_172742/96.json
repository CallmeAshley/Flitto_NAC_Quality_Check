    "text": "然而，也有一些类型的商品不太适合完全由自由市场来提供。\n例如公共物品，如国防、路灯等。 这些物品具有非排他性和非竞争性，即一个人使用不会减少其他人的使用，而且很难排除他人的使用。 在自由市场中，由于难以向使用者收费，私人企业往往缺乏提供这些物品的动力。\n另外，对于一些具有外部性的商品，如污染严重的工业产品，自由市场可能无法充分考虑其对社会造成的负面影响，导致过度生产。",
    "trans": "However, there are also some types of goods that are less suitable to be provided entirely by the free market.\nExamples are public goods, such as national defense and street lighting. These goods are non-exclusive and non-competitive, that is one person's use does not reduce the use by others, and it is difficult to exclude others from using them. In a free market, private firms often lack incentives to provide these goods because of the difficulty of charging users.\nIn addition, for some goods with externalities, such as industrial products with high pollution content, the free market may not be able to adequately take into account their negative impacts on society, leading to overproduction."
