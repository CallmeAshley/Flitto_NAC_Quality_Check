    "trans": "We have heard this version of the story from childhood to adulthood. However, someone told another version of this story.\nThe rabbit felt disappointed for losing the race, and it analyzed the reasons for its failure. The rabbit realized that it failed because it was overly confident, careless, and negligent in its actions, lacking proper precautions.\nIf it hadn’t been so self-assured, the turtle would never have had a chance to win. So, the rabbit challenged the turtle: to race again. The turtle agreed."
