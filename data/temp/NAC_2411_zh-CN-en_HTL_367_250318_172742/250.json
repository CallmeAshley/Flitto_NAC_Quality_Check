    "trans": "No one will catch a bowl of raw pain when it is splashed out; Rosemary's name is not to be spoken outwardly; America is only interested in three parts of his new love, however, it is surprising that mankind is still in the pursuit of fidelity. But the pain had to fall somewhere, forced by the authority of physics; so it fell on their spines.\nHe alone bore the burden of a language, the language of pain, that only he understood on earth. The soft inaudible sharp gasp. The twitching of his Adam's apple. The slight fading of knuckles. The slight tremor in the corners of his eyes. The breaking of the cocoon. How long had this cocoon been broken? He was alone in his futile attempt to capture Jack's pain, like a blind man standing in the eye of a storm, saddened by the coolness of the air currents.\nThat pain would always be just incoherent words to him, and he would spend a lifetime chasing gravels."
