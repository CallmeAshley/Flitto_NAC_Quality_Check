One day, he encountered an old woman who was incessantly grinding a large iron pestle. Curious, Li Bai asked her what she was doing. The old woman looked up, smiling cheerfully, and replied, “I’m grinding it into a needle to use for sewing.” Li Bai was even more puzzled and exclaimed, “How is that possible?” The old woman, now solemn, said earnestly, “Learning requires perseverance, and doing anything demands dedication. With enough effort, even an iron pestle can be ground into a needle.” Deeply moved, Li Bai returned home and devoted himself to his studies. He eventually became a great poet, leaving behind many outstanding works of poetry!\nFarewell to Meng Haoran at Yellow Crane Tower\nMy old friend bids me farewell at Yellow Crane Tower.
