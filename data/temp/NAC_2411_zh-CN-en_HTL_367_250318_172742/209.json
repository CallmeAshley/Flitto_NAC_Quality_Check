Her upper body was upside down, her nose was sore and her eyes were blurry.\nShould she be thankful that she escaped from the gates of hell again?\nZhan Dongqing walked to the bedside, and after a while he looked up and saw Su Liangmo still in this position, \"Come here.\"\nHer shoulders trembled slightly, but her feet did not move.\nThe Italian lamps hanging from the four corners drew out a bleak and long figure of a person. Zhan Dongqing looked at Su Liangmo's lowered head, \"What's your father's name?\"\n\"Su Kang.\""
