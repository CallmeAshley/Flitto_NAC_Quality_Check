    "trans": "This was very painful for Dong Wan. She had managed to survive a uterine contraction. With these little babies in her womb making a lot of trouble, her entire body went limp. Then her petite hips slid backward, and she completely snuggled into Cao Cao's embrace.\nThe sound of hoofbeats clattered in the night, and the two horsemen flashed through the forest path one after the other. The violent bumps brought about by the horses' gallop almost shook Dong Wan's bones apart.\nHer pregnant belly had become as hard as a rock, and the swelling and cramping pains in her womb were getting stronger and stronger. Dong Wan was limp in Cao Cao's arms. One hand was holding the bottom of her hardened belly, the other was rubbing her aching back. She was sweating and murmuring."
