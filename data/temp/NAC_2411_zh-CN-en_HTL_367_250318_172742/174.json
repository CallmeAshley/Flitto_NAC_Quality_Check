    "text": "我们穿上曾经的球衣，在院子里打起了篮球。 就像二十年前那样，放肆地奔跑、欢笑。 爷爷坐在一旁，虽然不能起身参与，但他一直笑着为我们加油助威。\n打完球后，我们围坐在爷爷身边，一起回忆那些美好的时光。 哥哥拿出了一本旧相册，里面都是我们小时候和爷爷的合影。 我们一页页地翻着，给爷爷讲述着照片背后的故事。\n“爷爷，您还记得那次我摔了一跤，哭鼻子，您安慰我的时候吗？” 我笑着问。",
    "trans": "We put on our old jerseys and started playing basketball in the yard. Just like twenty years ago, we ran freely and laughed heartily. Grandpa sat nearby. Although he couldn’t get up and join us, he kept cheering and supporting us with a smile.\nAfter playing, we gathered around Grandpa, reminiscing about those beautiful times together. My brother took out an old photo album, full of pictures of us as children with Grandpa. We flipped through it page by page, telling Grandpa the stories behind the photos.\nGrandpa, do you remember that time I fell and cried, and you comforted me?” I asked with a smile."
