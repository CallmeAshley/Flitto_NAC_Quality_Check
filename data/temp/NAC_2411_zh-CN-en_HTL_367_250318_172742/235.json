    "text": "看着眼前一地至高守卫的机体碎片，Starscream瘫软地坐在地上，瑟瑟发抖。 他亲眼目睹了D16如何把他的下属撕碎，如何用他手臂上那杆融合炮轰开这些飞行者的胸口，把他们的火种炸成溢散于空气中、最终无影无踪的能量残渣。\n“放过我。” Starscream低声下气地说。\n首领之位上的D16张开了自己的双腿，挡板紧闭，他露出了一个邪魅的笑容。 如果Orion见到D16此时的表情，一定会大惊失色。",
    "trans": "Starscream sat limply on the ground, trembling, as he stared at the debris of Supreme Guards scattered before him. He had witnessed with his own eyes how D16 tore his subordinates to pieces, how the fusion cannon on his arm blasted open the chests of these fliers, and how their sparks were obliterated into energy residue, dissipating into the air and eventually disappearing without a trace.\n“Spare me,” Starscream pleaded submissively.\nD16, seated on the leader's throne, spread his legs. With the panel firmly closed, he revealed a sinister smile. If Orion were to see the expression on D16's face at that moment, he would surely be shocked and appalled."
