    "text": "我知道你不喜欢我碰你，但这是你自己选择的路，所以只能由你自己来承担。 因为现在的你，根本就弱到什么都要不起。” 纵然是实话，但听起来却那么伤人。 季悦枫知道，自己之所以会和秦芮分开，一大部分原因在于季牧染。 可自己，也该有责任。\n如果自己再厉害一点，再强大一点，是不是就可以保护好秦芮? 不会受到季牧染的威胁?",
    "trans": "I know you don’t like me to touch you, but this is the path you chose yourself, so you can only bear it yourself. Because the current you is so weak that you can’t afford anything. Even though it’s the truth, it sounds so hurtful. Ji Yuefeng knew that the reason for separating from Qin Rui was largely because of Ji Muran. But he himself should also bear some responsibility.\nIf he were stronger, more powerful, could he have protected Qin Rui? Would he not have been threatened by Ji Muran?"
