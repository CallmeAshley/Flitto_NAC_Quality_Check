    "trans": "She has indeed let go of the bullying when she was a child, because there are many people around her who love her. She is not lacking in love, and is willing to share love with those around her. But Orm sometimes has moments of insecurity, and also has the thoughts that if she had been more mature at that time, her mother would not be so worried.\nEverything in the world always urges people to grow up, but someone tells her in a slow and gentle tone, \"You have already become a perfect adult.\"\nPerhaps sometimes, we are not insecure, but just want someone's affirmation."
