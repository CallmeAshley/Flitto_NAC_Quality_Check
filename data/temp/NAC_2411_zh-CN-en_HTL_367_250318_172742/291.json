The abnormal breakdowns in the production line happened mainly on WCD265-40 and WD270-40 electrolytic paper produced on August 18th, and the foreign objects extracted by short-circuiting capacitors were found in WCD265-40/WD270-40 electrolytic paper;\nb. Through the electron microscope analysis of the foreign objects, they are found to be in the form of a thin sheet with a thickness of 2-3 μm and a width that can reach 200 μm;"
