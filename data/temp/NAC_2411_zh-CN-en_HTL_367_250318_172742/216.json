    "text": "上次任务的时候，你们要从二楼跳到一楼，其实你自己有能力下去，但他还是把你稳稳的接住了。 你当时就在想，多有力量的手臂啊。\n但是现在这双手臂正把你困在门上。 König发烫的呼吸洒在你的颈侧。 他嘴里咕哝着你听不懂的语言。\n两分钟前你刚刚从浴室出来，突如其来的敲门声下了你一跳，这时候那群臭男人应该还在休息室里狂欢，这个时候来找你的只可能是来借洗发水的女队友。",
    "trans": "In the last mission, you had to jump from the second floor to the first floor. You were able to jump down by yourself, but he still caught you firmly. You were thinking at that time, what strong arms.\nBut now these arms are trapping you on the door. König's hot breath sprinkles on the side of your neck. He mumbles in a language you don't understand.\nYou just came out of the bathroom two minutes ago, and the sudden knock on the door surprised you. At this time, the group of stinky men should still be partying in the lounge. The only one who came to you at this time could be a female teammate who came to borrow shampoo."
