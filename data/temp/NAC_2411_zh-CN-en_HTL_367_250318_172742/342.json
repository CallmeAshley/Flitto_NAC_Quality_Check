    "trans": "Main attractions around West Lake\n- Mountains\nYat-sen Park, originally the imperial garden of the Qing Dynasty, was named so in 1927 in memory of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Upon entering the park, we can see the 2 Chinese characters “孤山” (meaning Lonely Mountain) inscribed on the stone steps, with the character “孤” (meaning lonely) missing a dot, leading people to speculate that it means “Lonely Mountain is not lonely”. Fanghe Pavilion, located in the northeast corner of Lonely Mountain, was built in memory of Lin Bu, a famous figure from the Song Dynasty known for his love of plum and cranes, often referred to as “Plum as Wife and Crane as Child”. The Zhejiang Provincial Museum is located in the southern foot of Lonely Mountain, housing a variety of cultural relics."
