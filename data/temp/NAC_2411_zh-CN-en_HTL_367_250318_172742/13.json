    "text": "关于贡献率的美元数值，这种说法不太准确。 贡献率是一个相对比例的概念，是各产业对 GDP 增长的贡献占 GDP 增长的比重，并不是用美元来衡量的。 如果要了解各产业对 GDP 的绝对贡献值（以人民币计算），需要根据国家统计局公布的详细数据进一步分析，但目前无法简单地将其换算成美元数值来衡量各产业的贡献率情况。",
    "trans": "Regarding the monetary value of these contributions in USD, this interpretation is not entirely accurate. Contribution rate is a relative proportional concept, representing the share of GDP growth attributed to each industry rather than being measured in monetary terms like USD. To determine the absolute contribution of each industry to GDP (calculated in RMB), a detailed analysis based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics would be required. However, it is not currently feasible to simply convert these figures into USD to assess the contribution rate."
