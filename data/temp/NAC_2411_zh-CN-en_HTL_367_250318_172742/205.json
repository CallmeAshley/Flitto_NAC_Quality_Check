    "text": "🟢狂a+视觉化效果加倍，我特别喜欢这一点，当我花10分钟专注去a的时候，就会结合相应的画面，此时的感受力是特别强的，更容易让潜意识记住我们的肯定语。\n最后，我经常看到评论区会有“为了你，我还是变成了这个癫狂的样子”，很形象，但是我要说的是，不要为了a去抛弃你正常的生活轨迹，不要让自己困住了，不管是鲜花数Sp、还是💰、外貌，最终的目标都是为了让我们的生活更加美好呀‼️‼️",
    "trans": "🟢Crazy a+ doubles the visual effect. I like this point very much. When I spend 10 minutes focusing on a, I will combine the corresponding pictures. At this time, my sensitivity is particularly strong, which makes it easier for the subconscious mind to remember our affirmation.\nFinally, I often see comments saying \"For you, I still become this crazy\", which is very vivid, but what I want to say is, don't abandon your normal life trajectory for a, don't let yourself be trapped, whether it is the Sp for number of flowers , or 💰, appearance, the ultimate goal is to make our life better‼ ️‼ ️"
