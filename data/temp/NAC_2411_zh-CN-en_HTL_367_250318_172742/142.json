    "trans": "Fang Huilan stated that the Reform of Housing Mortgage Insurance and Canada Secondary Suite Loan Program will make it easier for homeowners to convert their unused basements into apartments for rent or transform a garage into laneway, thereby increasing community density.\nThe secondary suite can help homeowners pay off their mortgages with the income from the new apartments for rent and make family members closer."
