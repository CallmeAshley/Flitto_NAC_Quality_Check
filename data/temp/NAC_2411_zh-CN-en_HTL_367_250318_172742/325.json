    "trans": "Princess Tabia swiftly returned to the kingdom with her magic wand. Standing at the highest point of the castle, she raised the wand high and began to chant the ancient imprecations. The star at the tip of the wand unleashing a powerful magical force, its radiance beaming dispelled the curse of darkness just like rays of sunlight. The castle once again shone with a dazzling brilliance, and the flowers in the garden bloomed once again, which were more gorgeous and colorful than ever before. The village also came from laughter, people's faces filled with a happy smile."
