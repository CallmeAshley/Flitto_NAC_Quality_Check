    "text": "陡然承受过多的情感与回忆是无比痛苦的。 许多被王冠选中的人都没来得及留下姓名，就因陷入癫狂而死去。\n而以勒什没有坠入疯狂，他承受住了这一切。 正因为他足够清醒，才越来越绝望。\n黑冠向他，也向我揭露了一个事实——\n我们所构想的，属于萨卡兹的未来，很有可能只是萨卡兹某段历史的重复。\n一切建起来的都终将归于毁灭。",
    "trans": "It is extremely painful to suddenly bear too many emotions and memories. Many people chosen by the crown died of madness before leaving behind their names.\nHowever, Elesh did not fall into madness. He endured all of this. But It was just because he was sober enough that he became more and more desperate.\nBlack Crown revealed a fact to him and me -\nThe future we envision for Sarkaz is likely to be just a repetition of a certain period of Sarkaz history.\nEverything that is built will eventually end in destruction."
