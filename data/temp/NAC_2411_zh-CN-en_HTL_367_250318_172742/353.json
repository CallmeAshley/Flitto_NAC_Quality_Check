    "trans": "However, in the long run, simply accepting bad situations will not solve new problems. Although people may feel calm about difficult situations, society is constantly changing and will bring new challenges and difficulties. On the contrary, those who actively face difficulties and strive to improve are more prepared to deal with emergencies, so they are more likely to overcome difficulties.\nFor me, we can learn a lot of knowledge and gain experience in improvement and challenges. To get out of bad situations, people need to try some methods and techniques that they may not have tried before. So, before challenging, people should first improve their abilities and endurance."
