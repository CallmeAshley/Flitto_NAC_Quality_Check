    "trans": "Nishimura Riki snored in his arms. He was really exhausted today. Lee Heeseung stared at the undulating hill, tracing its curves in the darkness, before repeating in his mind the definitive statement that he was really working hard.\nHe remembered that he was an insecure man, a firefly flitting in a gray mist. If there was a one percent chance of deviation, he would have simply given up pretending he didn't care. But Nishimura Riki's love had been overt and undisguised, like a stretch of clear-to-blue sea water, where he lay sleeping in a rubber ducky boat, with the small fish swimming underneath looking at him curiously, and in return had drifted unconsciously from the shore to the center of the ocean."
