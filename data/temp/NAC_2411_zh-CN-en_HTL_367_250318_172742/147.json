The teacher asked: \"Why?\"\nThe student said: \"Because I hate one of them.\"\nThe teacher let him change. But the teacher asked: \"Do you hate all the other members in the group too?\"\nThe student said: \"No, I like them all.\"\nThe teacher said: \"Is that person important in your life?\"\nThe student replied: \"Hell no! I hate him!\"\nThe teacher said: \"Ten good friends couldn't stop you to leave, but you left only for him. Don't you think this person is unimportant to you?\""
