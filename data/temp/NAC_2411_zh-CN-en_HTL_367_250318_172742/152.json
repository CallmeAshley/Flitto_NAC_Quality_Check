    "text": "南京是全新的惊喜，有我一个人在家听哭的稀里哗啦的莫欺少年穷，有让你又变成小哭包的干杯，还有我们这个年纪才会唱的心动！ 所有的所有都是你爱的体现。 有人说粉丝对偶像的爱是最无私的，但是在你这里我感受到的是比粉丝爱你更汹涌热烈的回馈！\n从手心到脉搏的小炭火，不知道下次会出现在你身体的那个地方，我猜最后是@MIC檀健次JC-T",
    "trans": "Nanjing is a whole new surprise that there are “Do not Tease the Poor Young” that made me cry my eyes out when I listen to it alone at home, “Cheers” that turns you cry again, and “Tempted”, a song only people at our age would sing! Everything is a manifestation of your love. Some say the love of fans for their idols is the most selfless, but what I feel from you is an even more passionate and overwhelming response than fans love you!\nThe small charcoal fire from the palm of your hand to your pulse, I wonder where it will appear on your body next time. I guess that it will finally be with @MIC Tan Jianci JC-T"
