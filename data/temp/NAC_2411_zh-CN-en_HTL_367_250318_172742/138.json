    "trans": "Moreover, most importantly, his daughter could be considered as raised for the emperor for free, because in Shao Xun’s eyes, perhaps everything should be ranked after the interests of the country, to put it bluntly, the emperor’s interests. So, no one could tempt her with interests or usurp the power that belongs to the emperor through her.\nFor this daughter who is almost a free gift to the emperor, Shao Zhenyu initially felt a bit tricky, but later he realized that it didn’t matter since he didn’t want to usurp the throne or hold power over the court. He was essentially loyal to the emperor, which had no conflict with Shao Xun at all.\nOn the contrary, this might be the reason why Shao Xun could tolerate British Palace standing on her son’s boat."
