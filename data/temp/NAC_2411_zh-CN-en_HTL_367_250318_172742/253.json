    "text": "他求助于六边形来支撑外墙的双重曲率，一个具有他所要寻找的结构和视觉参数的几何形。 总共1.5万块六边形铝板覆盖了整个建筑表皮，具有1000种不同尺寸，依靠电脑设计组织成蜂窝状图形。 为了应对结构的挑战，罗梅罗找来奥雅纳(OveArup)工程顾问公司洛杉矶分公司和Gehry工程技术公司，一起完成这个非常规的建筑结构和外层表皮。",
    "trans": "He turned to hexagons to support the double curvature of the exterior walls, a geometry that had the structural and visual parameters he was looking for. A total of 15,000 hexagonal aluminum panels covered the entire building skin, with 1,000 different sizes, organized into a honeycomb pattern by computer design. To meet the structural challenges, Romero brought in the Los Angeles branch of Ove Arup, and Gehry to complete this unconventional building structure and outer skin."
