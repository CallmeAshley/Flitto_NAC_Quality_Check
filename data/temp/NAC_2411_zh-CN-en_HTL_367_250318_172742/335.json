    "trans": "Xie Lian was stunned.\nHe didn't expect this person to follow him here. What's more, he didn't anticipate that he would actually grab his steamed buns!\nAfter being shocked for a while, he remembered to take them back. He jumped up and said, \"Give them back to me!\"\nHe acted extremely fast, but the man's movements were even faster. And the man was also taller than him, so he dodged and said, \"Don't eat this.\"\nHe said so, but he took a bite of that steamed bun and left a bite mark. Now, Xie Lian couldn't eat it even if he wanted to. He was the prince. There was no way he was going to eat a steamed bun that someone had taken a bite out of. His eyes widened and he said, \"You!\"\nHe paused for a moment and said angrily, \"Why did you do that?\""
