    "trans": "Qiao is an American who became good friends with Hong, a Chinese visiting scholar, while studying for a doctorate at a university in the United States. Later, Hong returned to China and invited Qiao to visit his school. Hong hosted Qiao very warmly and arranged a five-day itinerary for Qiao. Qiao was grateful for Hong's hospitality, but he wanted to get to know the city himself. Qiao did not refuse Hong's arrangement out of courtesy, but he was frustrated with the visit. When the trip was over, Hong thought that Qiao's visit was a success. But Qiao felt like a prisoner who had lost his freedom."
