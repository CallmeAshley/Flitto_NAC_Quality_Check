    "trans": "Mr. Xue from Zhejiang Province had just gotten married and was buying furniture in a shopping mall. He just picked a mattress and was about to pay for it.\nBefore the money was transferred, the owner of the furniture store reminded him, \"After you get the mattress home, you must tear off the film on it.\"\nMr. Xue was puzzled. If the film is not torn off, the mattress doesn't need to be cleaned. Why must he do so?\nMattresses are a necessity for every family, and newly purchased mattresses will have a layer of plastic film on them.\nThe purpose of this plastic film is to protect the new mattress.\nAfter new mattresses leave the factory, there is a high probability that they will not be sold immediately, and some mattresses will be stored in warehouses for a period of time before they are taken away."
