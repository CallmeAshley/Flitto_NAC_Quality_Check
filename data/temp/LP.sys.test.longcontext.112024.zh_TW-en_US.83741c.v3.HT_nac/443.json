So, the things you have been worrying about, like dark skin, acne scars, stretch marks, a flat nose, and even obesity, I actually can't see clearly.\nYou are my closest lover and the wife I will care for in the future. As long as I don't mind those little problems, you don't need to worry anymore. And since my eyesight will continue to get worse, let's cook and eat foods that protect our vision together.\nMedical reports say that boys need to frequently look at beautiful women to protect their vision and extend their lifespan. I believethat this is true, so every day, you should let me see your beautiful, smiling face, your sexy underwear, hips, and thighs."
