The two of them first went to clean up in the bathroom, and then lay down on the new bedsheet that felt nice to the skin. [redacted_name] proactively crawled down to give him oral sex, which gave [redacted_name] pleasure throughout the body. Furthermore, as he hadn't had intimacy for some time, his body was highly sensitive, so it was rather difficult to pretend to not be aroused. Soon he felt his penis swell in [redacted_name]'s mouth.\n[redacted_name] looked up at him happily, so [redacted_name] smilingly squeezed his swollen cheeks.\n\"You can now swallow without honey?\""
