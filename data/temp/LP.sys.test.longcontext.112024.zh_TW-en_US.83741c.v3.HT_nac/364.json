    "text": "對船的第一印象感覺稍微有點年紀，但多年來似乎都有好好維護，所以整體來說有種老舊卻還算乾淨的那種氛圍。 總共有五層，四五層除了桌椅之外，大部分公共設施都在第三層。 大概晃過一圈，有一間遊戲廳，裡面擺了幾台夾娃娃機，兩台賽車遊戲機，三間Karaoke，另外一間賣的東西雖然不多，但足以滿足各種基本需求的便利店，當然還有好幾台投幣\n式飲料機。",
    "trans": "My first impression of the ship was that it seemed a bit aged, but it appeared to have been well-maintained over the years, giving it an overall vibe of being old yet reasonably clean. The ship has five decks. Most public facilities are located on the third deck, with the fourth and fifth decks mainly featuring chairs and tables. After a quick tour, I found an arcade with a few claw machines, two racing game machines, three Karaoke rooms, and a convenience store that, though not extensive in its offerings, met basic needs. Naturally, there were also several coin-operated\nbeverage machines."
