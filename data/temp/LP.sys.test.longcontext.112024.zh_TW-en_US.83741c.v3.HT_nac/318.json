If I were a resident of Keelung, I would\ncast a vote in favor of the recall.\nHowever, I want to remind everyone that the right to recall is a fundamental constitutional right.\nThe essence of democracy is for all citizens of Keelung to stand together this Sunday, to evaluate from a rational and factual standpoint, and to use their own\njudgment to reassess [redacted_name]'s performance in governance.\nRegardless of the outcome, this Sunday's recall vote will contribute to the growth of democracy, fostering the development of direct democracy in Taiwan."
