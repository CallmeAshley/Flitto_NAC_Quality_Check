    "trans": "When a child's response is accurate, but the system does not assign points for it, it may be due to some of the following reasons:\nThe question is based on vocabulary from an earlier textbook. Other textbooks have vocabulary that may also answers the question, but just by the system's judgment, the question will not be scored.\nThe answer has to be in the writing format; if there be any, probably spaces, case sensitiveness, punctuation errors, unfortunately, can't score the question.\nAnswers should be provided in English half-width characters. If English full-width characters are entered, the system will mark the question as ineligible for scoring."
