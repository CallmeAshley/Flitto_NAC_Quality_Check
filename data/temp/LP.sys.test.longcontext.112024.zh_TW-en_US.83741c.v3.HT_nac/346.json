The steady rhythm was disrupted by the beeping of the ECG monitor. He gradually forgot the song his finger was drumming. The nurse told him not to move his fingers, and he reluctantly complied, fearing he might die by mistake. Even the little dog was lying on the coffin, crying.\nThis was the worst injury he had ever suffered. He never wanted it to happen again. The fear of losing control over his life and death was terrifying; he didn’t want to leave in such helplessness.\n[redacted_name] wandered in his thoughts as the oxygen mask covering his nose and mouth began delivering anesthesia."
