    "text": "很多人都問我為什麼不貼勃起的照片。 其實這兩張照片我都有貼過。\n只是，就像這兩張照片的不同，對某些人來說，可能希望它佔到版面的三分之一。 像左邊這張圖。\n但，對我來說，勃起不勃起，只是在討論身體或裸體這個主題的一小部分，就像右邊這張圖一樣。\n而且，勃起的屌照在網路上很容易找到，我覺得不缺我的一張照片。 反而是平常的、柔軟的屌，是更常在生活裡存在的狀態，但不太被重視。",
    "trans": "Many people ask me why I don't post pictures of erections. Actually, I have posted both of these photos.\nHowever, just like the difference between these two photos, some people might want them to take up a third of the page, like the picture on the left.\nBut for me, whether it's erect or not is just a small part of the discussion about the body or nudity, like the picture on the right.\nMoreover, photos of erect penises are easy to find online, and I don't feel the need to have one of my own. On the contrary, the usual, soft penis is more commonly present in daily life but not given much attention."
