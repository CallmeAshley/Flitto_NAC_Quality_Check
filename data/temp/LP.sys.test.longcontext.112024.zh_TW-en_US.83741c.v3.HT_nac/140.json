WUS will use this case as a Meta Issue to conduct an audit (tentatively on November 6th). At that time, both system and paper documents need to be prepared.\nIn May of this year, there was an issue with the 872SLK laser engraving incorrect surfaces, and in August, there was a customer complaint regarding the 943SN air bubbles. Please be aware of these issues, as customers may have the opportunity to review them.\nAfter tomorrow morning's meeting, we will discuss this matter. Please have the relevant departments attend the meeting at 12:00 PM in the main conference room.\n<[redacted_id]>\nChangshu Factory has dispatched personnel to sort three batches with the following appearance defects:\n<[redacted_id]>"
