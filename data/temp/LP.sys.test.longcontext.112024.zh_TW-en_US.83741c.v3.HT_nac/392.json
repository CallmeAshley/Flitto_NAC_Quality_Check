    "trans": "The incident occurred on October 8th near a port in Tahiti. Maritime traffic data showed that a ferry was traveling at a speed of 30 knots, well over the 5-knot speed limit, when it collided head-on with a young mother whale named [redacted_name]. Part of her upper jaw was severed, and blood continuously poured out.\nOcean conservation organization [redacted_name] founder Bennett ([redacted_name]) told the Daily Mail that they were alerted at 9:50 AM and immediately rushed to the scene. However, [redacted_name] died due to severe nasal bone damage and fractures. As she could not surface after the collision, she tragically drowned and slowly sank to the ocean floor."
