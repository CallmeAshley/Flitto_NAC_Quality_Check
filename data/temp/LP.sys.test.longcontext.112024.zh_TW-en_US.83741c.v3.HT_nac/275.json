    "text": "此次應對主要是針對近來北韓頻對南韓施放「垃圾氣球」，加上北韓參謀總部下達「做好完全射擊準備」之指示，不排除北韓對在發放傳單時進行砲擊。\n有鑑於此，南韓也宣布對北韓發放傳單是引發軍事衝突的危險行為，因此實施禁止，京畿道政府計畫將對被列為危險區域的地方派遣司法警察，強力取締對北韓發放傳單的行為，嚴厲究責。",
    "trans": "This response is mainly aimed at North Korea's recent frequent release of \"junk balloons\" at South Korea. In addition, as the North Korean Joint Staff Headquarters issued an instruction to \"be fully prepared for shooting\", it cannot be ruled out that North Korea will carry out artillery fire when distributing leaflets.\nIn view of this, South Korea also announced that the distribution of leaflets to North Korea is a dangerous act that may trigger military conflict, and therefore it is prohibited. The Gyeonggi Province government plans to dispatch judicial police to those listed as dangerous areas to forcefully ban the distribution of leaflets to North Korea and to strictly pursue accountability."
