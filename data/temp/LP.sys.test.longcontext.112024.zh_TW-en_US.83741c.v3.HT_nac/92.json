    "trans": "It seemed like he saw me, and he chased me all the way to a convenience store.\nI kept trying to hide from him, but he kept looking for me. Eventually, I ran back home. By the way, in my dream I lived on the eighth floor. I realized my door was unlocked even though I was sure I had locked it before I left. Just then, someone was about to come out from inside, so I bolted for the elevator. He chased me and almost got in with me, but fortunately the elevator doors closed in time. When I reached the first floor, I ran straight to the front desk and told security that someone was in my home (and in the dream, I was speaking English)."
