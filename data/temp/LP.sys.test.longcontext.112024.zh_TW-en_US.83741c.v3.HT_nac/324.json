    "text": "⚠️造口周圍滲液較多時，使用三明治法噴塗造口粉及皮膚保護劑——先造口粉，待吸收（吸收後皮膚上看不到明顯白色粉末）後皮膚保護劑，待乾，再造口粉➕皮膚保護劑\n3. 造口袋滲漏考慮原因可能還是造口袋材質問題（患兒目前腸管高低不平且整體較低，使用之前款式造口袋易滲漏）\n4. 患兒下次做腸鏡檢查時，提醒醫生是否考慮造口拆線，患兒拆線後使用防漏環（如圖），不使用防漏膏。 防漏環使用方法：戴手套後，先用一張嬰兒用濕巾將防漏環沾濕（因防漏環非常粘手）",
    "trans": "⚠️ When excess leakage occurs around the stoma, use the \"sandwich method\" to apply stoma powder and skin barrier spray. First, apply stoma powder and let it absorb (the skin should not visibly show white powder), then apply skin barrier spray. After it dries, reapply stoma powder ➕ skin barrier spray.\n3. Stoma bag leakage may be caused by material issues with the stoma bag (the child's intestinal tract is currently uneven and relatively low, making previous stoma bag designs prone to leakage).\n4. During the child's next colonoscopy, remind the doctor to consider removing the stoma stitches. After removal, the child can use a leak-proof ring (as shown in the image) instead of leak-proof paste. Instructions for leak-proof ring: Wear gloves, and moisten the leak-proof ring with a baby wipe before applying it (the leak-proof ring is very sticky)."
