    "trans": "We do not seek heavenly blessings, we practice good deeds to help all beings, to assist them in overcoming suffering and attaining happiness,\nto help them break free from ignorance and gain enlightenment. We practice good deeds for this purpose. We do not seek heavenly rewards, only the rebirth in the Pure Land, and we dedicate all merits to rebirth in the Pure Land. Therefore, all the good deeds we perform transform into merit. We diligently pursue goodness and act sincerely when encountering good things. \"Upholding such practices,\" upholding means to follow the teachings, to practice according to the teachings, and to maintain them. The Buddha teaches us these principles in the sutras. Once we understand them, we turn our incorrect views around. The Buddha speaks of these practices and methods of cultivation in the sutras, and we transform them into our daily lives and actions. This is called walking the Bodhisattva path."
