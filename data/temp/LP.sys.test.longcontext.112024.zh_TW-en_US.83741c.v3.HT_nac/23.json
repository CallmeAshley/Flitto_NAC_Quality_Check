    "trans": "When [redacted_name] walked to the classroom entrance, through the crack in the door, she saw [redacted_name] sitting at the table in the study room, flipping through some documents with focused attention. [redacted_name]'s long black dress outlined her elegant figure, and her hair was draped casually on her shoulders. Everything seemed to exude a calming atmosphere.\nShe took a deep breath, adjusted her breathing, and then mustered up the courage to pull the door open. The door creaked, instantly attracting [redacted_name]'s attention. [redacted_name] looked up in surprise. A gentle ray shone from her eyes, as if the sun was shining on her face."
