    "text": "P5 第二個認為他做法不正確有所爭議的地方是\n在攝影師作品集中有更多黑人或黑人兒童的照片，被攝者大多是潛在弱勢社群，作品無法確認攝影師是否有向被攝者取得同意，這些照片在被拍攝後以各種形式發佈，使攝影師或相關機構從中獲利，有利用弱勢社群在社會中的刻 板印象牟利的嫌疑，這對被攝者進行了二次傷害。\n以上就係呢一張相嘅爭議點",
    "trans": "P5 The second point of controversy regarding his approach is\nthat in the photographer's portfolio, there are more photos of Black people or Black children, most of whom are from potentially vulnerable communities. It is unclear whether the photographer obtained consent from the subjects. These photos, after being taken, are published in various forms, allowing the photographer or related institutions to profit from them. This raises suspicions of exploiting stereotypes about vulnerable communities for financial gain, resulting in secondary harm to the subjects.\nThis is the controversy surrounding this particular photograph."
