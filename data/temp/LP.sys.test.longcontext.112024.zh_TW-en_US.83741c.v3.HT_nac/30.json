It wasn't until the next day that we arrived in Paris, the capital of France.\nWhen I arrived in Paris, everything was new and curious to me, and I screamed with excitement. Children on the streets of Paris have beige and black hair. There are many roadside trees that I have never seen in China. Even my parents don’t know the names of these trees. There are many fruits we don’t recognize on the streets. There are high-rise buildings standing beside the roads. My father told me that this is where Parisians work. What's interesting is that there are thin and long lightning rods standing on the tops of those high-rise buildings."
