    "trans": "I know that an apology isn’t an eraser—it can’t wipe away those marks.\nBut I still want to say I’m sorry, for everything.\nI know you’re busy, and I’ve been waiting—it’s okay.\nI thought that if I didn’t bother you or bring anything up, you’d tell me once you were done.\nBut things turned out to be more complicated than I imagined.\nMaybe now I’m like a stranger to you.\nAfter all, it’s been so long since we’ve really spoken or stayed in touch.\nBut to me, you’re still the one I love. I still often recall our time together.\nThank you for the chance that once brought us together,\nand thank you for helping me back then at work. Thank you for loving me so much."
