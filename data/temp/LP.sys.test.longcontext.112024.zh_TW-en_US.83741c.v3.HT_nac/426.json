    "text": "一直在異世界裡孤獨前行，她一個人，周旋在一群大大小小，面目單調的“角色”中，做不算發自本願的事。 這條路安全但漫長。 從前並不急，因為對劇情了熟於心，按部就班走就是。\n現在卻有一種急切的感覺。 因為她窺見了生活另外的可能性。\n哪怕在這個世界，“惡毒女配”的面具和標簽也不是必需。 因為有一個人，在和他無間的交纏中，某一部分真實的她，似乎被輕易觸碰到了。 這是一種新鮮的體驗，帶著冒險性，卻很有誘惑力。",
    "trans": "She has always been alone in the other world, by herself, navigating among a group of characters of various sizes and monotonous appearances, doing things that are not necessarily of her own will. This path is safe but long. In the past, there was no rush, as she was familiar with the plot and could follow it step by step.\nNow, however, there is a sense of urgency. Because she has glimpsed another possibility of life.\nEven in this world, the mask and label of the \"evil female supporting character\" are not necessary. Because there is someone, in an inseparable entanglement with him, that a part of her true self seems to be easily touched. This is a brand new experience, full of adventure, yet very enticing."
