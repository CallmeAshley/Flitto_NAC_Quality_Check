    "trans": "Foreign investors heavily bought 27,000 lots of Foxconn stock yesterday, with the three major institutional investors all on the buying side, totaling 34,000 lots. Over the past five trading days, the three major institutions have accumulated a net purchase of 58,000 lots of Foxconn, which is the main driving force behind the rise in Foxconn's stock price. If the buying continues, Foxconn's market value will likely surpass 3 trillion yuan again today.\nInstitutions pointed out that Foxconn is the main supplier for Nvidia's GB200 AI servers, with production planned for November, shipment in December, and large-scale shipments expected next year, which is expected to significantly boost performance and attract early buying interest."
