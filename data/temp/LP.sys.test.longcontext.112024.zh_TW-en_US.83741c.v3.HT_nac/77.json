    "trans": "On the sixth day, we headed to the spot we’d seen from the airplane—Mikata Goko. The view was so stunning that we didn’t want to leave the mountain.\nWe had a blast up there and only came down because we were hungry. While searching for lunch, we stumbled upon a truly special place:\nTsunegami Peninsula. Although we didn’t get to try the fresh live seafood dishes, it was absolutely worth it just to take in the peaceful scenery of this small fishing village.\nI’d love to come back here if I get the chance.\nIn the end, we just couldn’t find a suitable restaurant, so we went back to Nagahama to enjoy one of Japan’s top three wagyu brands—\nOmi beef, served yakiniku-style. After filling up, we took a stroll around Hokoku Shrine, Kurokabe Square, and Nagahama Castle."
