It also received more than 800 species of woody and herbaceous plants donated by the [redacted_name] Arboretum of Harvard University in the United States, the Royal Botanic Gardens in the United Kingdom, the Forestry Experimental Site of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Japan, etc. and herbs. Forced by the Anti-Japanese War, Wuhan University moved westward to Leshan, Sichuan in 1938, leaving a large number of fruit trees and forest farms deserted. It was not until 1946 that it was moved back to Luojia Mountain and once again introduced and cultivated a large number of seedlings from Shennongjia in Hubei, Huangshan in Anhui, Lushan in Jiangxi, Yunnan and Guizhou regions and other places."
