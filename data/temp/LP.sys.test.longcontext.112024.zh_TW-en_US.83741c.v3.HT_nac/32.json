    "trans": "[redacted_name] didn't know that [redacted_name] was still refusing to let things pass with her. Although gossips on the Internet had been getting a lot of attention, the progress of the drama crew was unaffected.\nIt would have been easy if [redacted_name] was indeed just a pretty face with a sharp tongue, arrogant temper, and no acting skills. However, the truth was just the opposite. Although she didn't smile much, she was far from being arrogant. At most she could be said to be a little aloof.\nBesides, she also didn't lack acting skills. Otherwise, why did other actors frequently got yelled at by the director with a \"cut\"?"
