In high autumn, it’s fitting to compose soaring tunes;\nIn a prosperous era, we should sing poems of progress.\n12. Five stars shine on the sun and moon;\nFour modernizations strengthen the nation.\n13. The magnificent rivers and mountains add more beauty;\nA brighter China becomes even more radiant.\n14. Rivers and mountains stretch for thousands of miles;\nThe motherland enjoys eternal spring.\n15. Flowers bloom with fragrance across the land;\nThe red sun shines over all of China.\n16. Rivers and mountains glow with brilliance;\nThe sun radiates its light magnificently.\n17. The five-star flag shines on the sun and moon;\nFlowers bloom across four seasons, beautifying the land.\n18. United in building a great cause;\nTogether in revitalizing China.\n19. The eagle flies swiftly like an arrow, soaring with ambition."
