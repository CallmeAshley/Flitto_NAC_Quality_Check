    "trans": "From the parent questionnaire, we see that among the three parents who believe teachers are under pressure, those surveyed felt that increasing the use of television programs, radio shows, and the internet could help teachers convey their work-related difficulties to the public and the government—each channel was selected by 100% of these parents. Next in popularity were interpersonal networks and newspaper column interviews, chosen by 66.7%. The least-chosen channel was books, at only 33.3%. This indicates that television programs, in particular, could help teachers express their challenges to the general public."
