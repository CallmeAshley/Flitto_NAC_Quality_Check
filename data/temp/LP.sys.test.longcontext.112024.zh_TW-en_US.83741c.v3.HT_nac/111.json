    "trans": "Time: 1:00 PM\nPlace: An entrance to some pedestrian underpass\nPerson involved: A handsome guy in glasses\nK said he’d take me to get some food. As he was driving, he pulled over and said: “Get out of the car and go stand by that exit. In a moment, a cute guy will come find you, and you’ll give him your underwear.”\nWTF!!! He wants me to hand over my underwear to a total stranger?! Shit! Why is he only telling me this now… He does this to me every time…\nI grudgingly got out of the car and made my way to the stairs at a blazing speed of two centimeters per hour, my calm heartbeat racing at about 7,800 beats per minute as I looked around, waiting for the cute guy to appear. When he finally showed up, the first thing he said was: “Wow, K never told me you were this gorgeous.” (I did feel a bit consoled by that…)"
