    "trans": "It's not an exaggeration to say that the [redacted_name] family is too mysterious and has caused leaders from around the world to fear them.\nThe general who first spoke to [redacted_name] went over the pros and cons of the situation in his mind.\nWith a smile on his face, he approached [redacted_name], saying, \"I didn't know the head of the [redacted_name] family was also here. What a coincidence. I heard that someone in your family has passed away. Please accept my condolences, [redacted_name].\"\nSaying this, the general walked up to [redacted_name] and even extended his hand towards the man, whose entire body exuded a cold, piercing aura.\n[redacted_name] scanned the man across from him, saw his outstretched hands, and did not make any move."
