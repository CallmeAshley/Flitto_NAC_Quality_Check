He sighed softly and flicked his fingers. At the same moment, a pure white bat appeared beside [redacted_name]. \"This is my familiar. With it by your side, no other demon will dare to harm you.\"\nTeacher! [redacted_name] finally made it clear that he was willing to stay. [redacted_name] threw himself into Shen Yuan's arms with a look of joy on his face."
