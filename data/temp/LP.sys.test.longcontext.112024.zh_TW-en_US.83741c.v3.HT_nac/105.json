    "trans": "I know he has extracurricular activities every day.\nBut this English tutoring class\nis meant to strengthen his English skills.\nIf you agree for him to attend, please sign and return it.\nHowever, I’m aware he’s not very willing.\nWhenever he finds English class—or certain classes—difficult,\nhe tends to give up.\nHe doesn’t want to listen in class or do any assignments.\nEach time, it takes a lot of effort to talk to him.\nEventually, I’d mention speaking with you, and only then does he quietly copy notes or do a little bit of work.\nHe often uses the excuse that he doesn’t understand English, so he refuses to do anything.\nBut in reality, like with today’s test, the teacher had already told the students to write down the answers in their textbooks at the start of class."
