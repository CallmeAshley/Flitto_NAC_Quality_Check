    "trans": "When [redacted_name] regained consiousness, it was still complete darkness in front of his eyes. Compared to his sight, the sensation of touch throughout his body and the desire gushing from deep within made him realize his current situation right away. His bounded limbs and furthermore the object wreaking havoc between his lips highlighted the sexual act that was not initiated by him.\nHe was rather more surprised than angry about being violated. No one had ever dared to go near him without permission when he was unconscious, let along being so presumptuous. After a moment of surprise, unbounded anger arose. For an emperor who held the real power, it was not an exaggeration to say that millions would die when the emperor was angry."
