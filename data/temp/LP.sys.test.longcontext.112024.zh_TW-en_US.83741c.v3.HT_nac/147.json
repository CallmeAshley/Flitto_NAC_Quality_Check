    "trans": "[redacted_name] was stunned upon hearing this, glanced at him, and remained silent without struggling.\n\"[redacted_name],\" he whispered softly while leaning into the other’s embrace, \"you’re so good to me.\" Then his voice caught, \"You’re so good.\"\n[redacted_name]'s neck broke out in goosebumps as he looked down at the 35-year-old man in his arms. [redacted_name]'s face was much redder than when he got off the train, looking almost ripe. So, [redacted_name] walked a few steps faster toward the villa's main door. A servant came out to greet him and brought a suitcase out of the taxi.\n\"Actually, it's not impossible.\" [redacted_name] closed his eyes, his expression looking very painful."
