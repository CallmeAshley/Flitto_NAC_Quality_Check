    "text": "酒,啡,糖的比例剛剛好，不會太甜是基本\n比例上會佔據主力角色，酒味不會太重\nCream有別於我飲過所有嘅Irish coffee\n個cream係非常fluffy，cream味亦較淡身\n起初會唔慣，嫌唔夠cream味\n但越飲你就會明個原因，正因為咁的設定\n由你開頭飲到落最尾，\n奶,酒,啡的比例經驗係一致的，唔會出現飲到落底得返cream呢個問題，",
    "trans": "The ratio of wine, coffee, and sugar is just right. Not being too sweet is essential.\nIn terms of proportion, it takes the center role, while the alcoholic taste is too strong\nThe cream is different from all the Irish coffee that I have tasted\nThis cream is very fluffy, and the cream smell is also lighter\nAt first you may not be used to it, and think it is not creamy enough\nHowever, the more you drink the more you will understand the reason. It's precisely because of this setting\nFrom the beginning to the end of your drink,\nyou experience a consistent ratio of cream, wine, and coffee. There won't be the problem of having just cream when you get to the bottom."
