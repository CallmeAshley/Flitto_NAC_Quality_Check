    "trans": "It seems like I’ve never talked about our political stance?\nThat's right, perhaps many people have seen us on Patreon or other forums saying that we support Taiwan independence or Hong Kong independence, but to be honest, those are just labels that domestic idiots are putting on us.\nOur goal has always been to protect the intellectual property of our work. These methods are simply using the domestic censorship system to curb the spread of illegal channels. Simply speaking, it’s using your own curse to attack you."
