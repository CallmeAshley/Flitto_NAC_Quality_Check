    "trans": "\"No.\" [redacted_name] denied his thoughts. Perhaps he had never truly talked about his feelings. When faced with professional counselors at the hospital, instead of speaking out, he focused more on how to make them believe he was normal, harmless, without any aggression or self-destructive behavior, hoping they would let him go one day. So, he always played the role of a strong soldier. Of course, perhaps they could also see what he was doing, emphasizing that the medical help channels were always open to him."
