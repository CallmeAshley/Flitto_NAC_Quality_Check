Disciple [redacted_name] and [redacted_name] bowing their heads. You will lead the Taoist congregation, follow the rituals of the Yellow Talismans, and set up the mandala early. Once I take a bath and change clothes, I will worship sincerely.\n[[redacted_address]]\nIt is this: Purify the sanctuary as a homage to the imperial throne. The righteous path is in the heart of the people.\n[[redacted_address]]\nA high altar for the fairies is built on the sea, the sun is rising, all the gods and spirits are here, and all the stars come to pay homage. The flags are fluttering, and the sacrificial ceremony is held in the middle of July."
