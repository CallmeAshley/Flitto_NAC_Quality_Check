    "trans": "[redacted_name] sometimes feels that the decision he made back then was the right one. For example, right now, these mutated fireflies show no interest in their armored vehicle; it seems like they only care about whether their colors are still dazzling tonight.\nHe looked at [redacted_name], their eyes meeting evenly, both gazing into those emerald green eyes.\nBut when he thinks of [redacted_name], he feels a bit of regret for jumping into [redacted_name]'s cage. But that regret only arises when he thinks about [redacted_name].\nThree years, even though they had only known each other for a few months, [redacted_name] had waited for him for three years.\nHe climbed into the co-pilot seat and sat beside [redacted_name]."
