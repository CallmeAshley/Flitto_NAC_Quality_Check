    "trans": "Although [redacted_name]’s relationships within the crew weren’t all that awkward, compared to the other cast members, the staff seemed to like her a bit more.\nOnce everyone arrived, the main director invited everyone to sit at the round table. The waiter then began bringing out the dishes that had already been ordered.\nOriginally, [redacted_name] just wanted to eat quietly and then leave. However, it seemed as though the main director was deliberately making things difficult for her, pulling her over to sit in the seat next to the seat of honor—right beside him.\nTo the main director’s left was [redacted_name], to his right was the assistant director, and on the other side of the assistant director sat the producer."
