He walked towards the empty training ground of the estate. He randomly picked up a bow from the wooden rack, grabbed the quiver, and headed towards the target range.\nThe bowstring was drawn to its limit, and the young man focused entirely on his breath and the target in front of him. With a flick of his fingers, the sharp arrowhead sliced through the air at high speed, shooting straight toward the bright red circle.\nThe feel was excellent, and he quickly picked up another arrow from the bucket at his side, rapidly nocking the bow and shooting with precision."
