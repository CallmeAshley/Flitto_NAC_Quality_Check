It is a set of pick-up techniques originated in the United States. Initially, it was used by men with poor social skills to improve their success rate in striking up a conversation with women through psychological techniques. Later, it gradually evolved into a term with a negative connotation, referring to the use of threats and inducements to force someone to submit by understanding their thinkings; with the rapid development of social media, it even evolved into a criminal model.
