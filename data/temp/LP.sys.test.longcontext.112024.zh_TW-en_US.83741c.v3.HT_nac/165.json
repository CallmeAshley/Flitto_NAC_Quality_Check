    "trans": "The boys were punching and kicking [redacted_name] while viciously cursing: \"Bastard!\", \"Trash King!\", \"Born by a mother but not raised by one!\"... and other vile words pierced into [redacted_name]'s ears. However, he seemed to not hear them at all. He hugged his head, like a boiled shrimp, and remained silent.\n[redacted_name]'s lack of resistance made the boys lose their energy after kicking and beating him for a while."
