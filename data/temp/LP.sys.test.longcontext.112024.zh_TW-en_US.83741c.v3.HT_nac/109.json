    "trans": "Upon learning that [redacted_name] had been captured, [redacted_name] was deeply heartbroken. She donated all her property, hoping that the emperor could bring [redacted_name] back. However, when the ministers realized that [redacted_name] could not be rescued, they quickly nominated [redacted_name]'s younger brother, Emperor Daizong, as the new emperor. After Emperor Daizong ascended the throne, [redacted_name] finally understood that everyone had already given up on [redacted_name]. Nevertheless, [redacted_name] refused to abandon the rescue efforts for [redacted_name]. She cried every day, causing blindness in one eye, and one of her legs became crippled from kneeling in prayer for extended periods."
