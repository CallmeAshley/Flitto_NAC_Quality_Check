She had finally memorized most of them, and she also asked some neighbors to serve as witnesses.\nOn the morning of the day of the trial, she thought about Yan Zheng's abnormal behavior in the past two days, and went to the south room and said, \"Your handwriting is good. If you have time today, please draft the divorce agreement first. After I transfer the ownership of my parents' house and land, I will just write down my name on it when I'm back. Once you recover from your injury, you can go wherever you want.\"\nHe had made it clear from the beginning that he would leave after his injury healed. The only thing Fan Changyu could think of at the moment was that he was probably worried she would go back on her word and and refuse to fulfill the original promise after the property transfer."
