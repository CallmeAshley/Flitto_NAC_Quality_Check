    "trans": "To be honest, when I first started writing lyrics and composing, I based everything on what Brother Wang liked. If he thought it was good, I was okay with it; if he didn’t, I would find ways to revise it further. After countless edits, I finally became more adept at it today.\nIt suddenly dawned on me that regardless of whether I agree or not, discussing a broader world through music is a meaningful thing.\nThe relationships between people are fragile, yet humans are incredibly resilient individuals—at least most of the time, more resilient than we imagine. And so, humanity has managed to survive in this vast natural world until now."
