    "trans": "Also he was less familiar with the course topics, making it difficult for him to take the lead in task delegation and participate in discussions\nInitially, he volunteered to be the group leader because it offered bonus points. Based on this, I assessed that his willingness to invest in this general education course was relatively low.\nSolution: I explained to the group leader the responsibilities that a group leader should fulfill in this course and tactfully asked whether he wished to continue\nserving as the group leader or would prefer to give the opportunity to another classmate. He chose the latter. Therefore, I invited the group leader and a\nmore proactive group member for a discussion. The group leader explained his situation and asked the member if they were willing to take over the role."
