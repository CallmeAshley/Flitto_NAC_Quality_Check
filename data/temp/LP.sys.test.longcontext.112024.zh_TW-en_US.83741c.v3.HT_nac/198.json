    "text": "無印良品是生活概念店，以提供實用日用品為主，主要顧客群為本地顧客。 因此，店舖選址重視該地點是否能貼近本地顧客的日常生活，讓區內顧客及鄰近上班人士能方便地購入生活所需。 是次新店選址鑽石山，為黃大仙區居民的主要生活圈之一。 無印良品相信透過荷里活廣場店，能接觸更多本地個人及家庭顧客，讓無印良品進一步融入顧客的生活。",
    "trans": "Muji is a lifestyle concept store that primarily offers practical daily necessities, with its main customer base being local residents. Therefore, store location selection emphasizes whether the location is close to the daily lives of local customers, allowing local residents and nearby workers to easily purchase daily necessities. The new store is located in Diamond Hill, one of the main living areas for residents in the Wong Tai Sin district. Muji believes that through the Hollywood Plaza store, it can reach more local individual and family customers, allowing Muji to further integrate into customers' lives."
