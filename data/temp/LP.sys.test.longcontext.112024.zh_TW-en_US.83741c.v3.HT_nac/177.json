    "trans": "Next is the second incision, called \"Covering the Eyes.\" This incision is made horizontally across the forehead, then pulled downward, tearing the skin to cover the eyes of Hong Tian Gui Fu. This is done to prevent the condemned person from making eye contact with the executioner, which could affect the process.\nThen, the two executioners stand on either side and begin cutting the chest. Each piece of flesh is about the size of a fingernail. For every ten pieces cut, they are held in hand and shaken outward with a shout. The audience below cheers in response. Next, the flesh is thrown onto the stage, where a designated person collects it for sale. People will buy it, claiming that drying it can cure scabies. The money from this sale goes to the executioners, as per the regulations."
