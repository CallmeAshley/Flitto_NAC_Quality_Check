    "trans": "1. No more judgment: When we accept the redemption of Christ, our sins are forgiven and therefore we will not be punished or judged by God for our sins.\n2. Freedom from God’s wrath: God’s wrath is against sin. Because we have been justified through Christ, God is no longer angry against us.\n3. Reconciliation with God: This means that our relationship with God is restored and we can now live in His love and grace without fear of His wrath."
