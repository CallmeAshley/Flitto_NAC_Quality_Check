    "trans": "Finally, he walked out of the bar with a blank expression, ignoring the guns and not caring about the bar manager who had been intimidating him from behind. He just stood there, staring ahead, leaving a trail of red blood on the ground.\nHe didn’t know how long he walked, but eventually, around 6 a.m., he returned to the Zhang household.\nThere was no one at the Zhang home. He didn’t turn on the lights and pushed open the study door with the faint morning light.\nThe study was exactly the same as when he left, not even the position of the papers had changed. He closed the door and walked like a zombie to sit behind the desk.\nFinally, his gaze fell on a photo of Qing Lin above the desk, and the corner of his mouth began to twitch."
