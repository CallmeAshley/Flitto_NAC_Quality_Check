    "trans": "\"[redacted_name], is it over early?\" She didn't even hear the sound of [redacted_name] knocking on the door. When [redacted_name] looked up, she saw that the other person had opened her door and was leaning on the door frame to talk to her.\n\"Sister, have you seen my frog? He's gone.\" [redacted_name] asked her sister deliberately while touching the empty bed.\n\"Ah, I wanted to hold on to something to sleep during my lunch break, so I borrowed it without telling you. I'm sorry.\"\n[redacted_name] didn't show any sign of suspicion or hesitation during the entire sentence, and didn't even pause. It was so unbelievably natural."
