    "trans": "The hardworking wife couldn't stay idle after work. As soon as she got home, she started preparing dinner for the family without resting. After dinner, the husband lay on the sofa watching TV. The wife began mopping the floor again, unsure if her husband even noticed her efforts.\nOn a whim, the husband decided to buy his wife a new coat. However, the wife thought the coat was ugly and didn't match her taste, blaming her husband for wasting money. What was meant to be a romantic gesture ended up causing a quarrel.\nIn our close relationships, when we feel like we're the only ones putting in effort and don't feel \"loved,\" where does the problem lie?"
