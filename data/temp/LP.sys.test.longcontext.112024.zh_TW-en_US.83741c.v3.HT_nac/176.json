    "trans": "Years later, the dog, who had saved enough money, opened his own meat bun shop next to the dock. The business of the bun shop became better and better, and the dog became too busy to talk to customers. Someone joked, \"The dog sells buns but doesn't talk to people.\" Over time, people started calling him \"Dog Doesn't Talk\", and the buns he made came to be known as \"Dog Doesn't Talk Buns.\"\nDog Doesn't Talk Buns has a history of over a hundred years, and it is still very popular today, a snack that can be found all over China."
