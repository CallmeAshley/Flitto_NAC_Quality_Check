    "trans": "[redacted_name] couldn't tell the reason, so was feeling uneasy. [redacted_name] readily smiled and said, “I want to apologize to you. I didn’t listen to you back then and ended up being trapped in Baiden. I almost couldn't see you again!”\nIt is a rare thing for an emperor to apologize to a minister. [redacted_name] was surprised and at a loss. [redacted_name] then ordered for a seat to be set up for him. Afterwards, the emperor and his minister discussed state affairs freely.\nIn the days that followed, the Xiongnu continued to invade the north, causing great headache to [redacted_name]. [redacted_name] took the emperor's urgent situation to heart and proposed a suggestion of \"marriage alliance\", which was adopted by [redacted_name]. This temporarily eased the relationship between the Han Dynasty and the Xiongnu."
