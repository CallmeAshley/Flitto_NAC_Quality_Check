    "trans": "Afterwards, [redacted_name] asked [redacted_name] to go to the factory director's office, while he himself walked out of the factory, spread a paper board under the shed used for protecting the truck from the rain outside the warehouse, and sat on the ground. He continued to practice his mudras, absorb spiritual energy, and at the same time release some spiritual energy to be constantly aware of the surroundings.\nIn the past few days, whenever [redacted_name] had free time, he had been practicing his mudras, and the spiritual energy accumulated in his body had become more and more abundant. He planned to pour all the spiritual energy into the ring gifted by [redacted_name] when the spiritual energy accumulated in his body reached a limit, to see if he could discover anything new.\nSoon, the sky gradually lit up."
