    "trans": "◎ Because Tianfu is at Yin, the same position as [redacted_name], the two main stars [redacted_name] and Tianfu are in the same position. When the two heroes meet, they are too powerful. Therefore, the person is smart and versatile, has strategic and leadership capabilities, is responsible and cautious in handling affairs, and has power throughout his life. Because two powers meet, the person is regretably a late bloomer and will only develop after the age of thirty-five. Money is put into the treasury, which indicates that he is calcuating, stingy, and miserly. He thends to be more willful and indulgent in doing things, so often experiences periodic feelings of emptiness and depression. In his childhood he is prone to disasters and injuries, lack of connection with his parents, or other defects."
