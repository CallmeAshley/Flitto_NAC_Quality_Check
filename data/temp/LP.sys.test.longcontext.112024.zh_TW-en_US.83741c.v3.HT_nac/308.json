    "trans": "• Harmony leads to prosperity in all things. While difficulties may arise, familial matters can be resolved, and household reputation can improve. Peace will gradually return to the home, and marriage will be long-lasting. Children are unlikely, though it’s possible to have a boy. Financial pursuits will be challenging but may succeed on certain auspicious days. Fame and recognition are unattainable, but overall fortune is balanced. Illness may linger, but there’s no need to fear on favorable days. Travel in the northeast direction is beneficial. Business ventures will see delayed profits, and visitors will arrive on specific days. Relocating is not advised. Lost items may be found in the northeast, especially on certain days. Legal matters will have favorable outcomes. Livestock is unlikely to thrive, but agricultural endeavors will see modest success. Construction projects are best undertaken after September. Gravesites will remain neutral. Fishing and aquaculture offer minimal benefits, with poor prospects for fish hatchlings. Communications may be delayed, and distant messages will arrive on specific days."
