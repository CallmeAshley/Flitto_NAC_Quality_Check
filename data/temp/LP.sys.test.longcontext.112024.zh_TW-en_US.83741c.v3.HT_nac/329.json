    "text": "當然,總也有過一些與狗相關的形容,不算太差。 比如他那些 露水情緣,總是帶著幾分佯怒,嗔他在榻上腰力如公狗,嘴上甜言勾 了人的魂魄,身下凶器奪了卿卿性命,但轉眼又去與旁人炫耀,搞得 瓦肆間人人皆知他墨微雨人俊器猛,試過的饕足意滿,沒試過的心弛 神 搖。\n狗。 不得不說,這些人講得很對,墨燃確實像是一隻搖頭擺尾的傻",
    "trans": "Of course, here had always been comparisons of him to a dog, and they weren't entirely bad. For instance, his fleeting romances were often accompanied by playful scolding, accusing him of having the stamina of a dog in bed. His sweet words would enchant his lovers, and his fierce strength would overwhelm them, but then he'd brag about it to others, making everyone in the marketplace know that Mo Weiyu was both charming and well-endowed. Those who had experienced it were thoroughly satisfied, while those who hadn't were left longing and awestruck.\nDog. It must be said that those descriptions were quite accurate. Mo Ran was indeed like a wagging, foolish pup."
