    "trans": "What's special is that there were actually negative actions towards SUGA on that day, but fans covered it with love and support, making it even more meaningful.\nOn the 9th of last month, an international ARMY alliance composed of 127 fan clubs from 58 countries, including South Korea, released the \"7-member Statement in Support of BTS,\" which brought attention to the unity of the fans.\nThrough this support action, ARMYs demonstrated the power of unity and conveyed their love and support for BTS. This display by the fans is expected to contribute to enhancing BTS's status as global artists.\n----\nThere was a part where I skipped because of the dislike of the two words, but if possible, please press support on this post 🥺💜"
