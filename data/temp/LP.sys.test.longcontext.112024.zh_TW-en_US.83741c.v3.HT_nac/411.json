    "trans": "[redacted_name] gently stroked the wrinkled paper, which he had actually tried to smooth out some time ago, even pressing it with a heavy object, but it still couldn't return to its original state. Only those beautiful, graceful, delicate characters had not changed.\nHe carefully traced the few lines of small, delicate script, feeling the heavy and intense emotions within, and thought that he might have been overly sensitive about the matter of Xinghua Building.\nThe gentleman and his uncle were old acquaintances, and it was normal to drink and argue, but for some reason, he always felt that his uncle's attitude towards the gentleman was somewhat strange."
