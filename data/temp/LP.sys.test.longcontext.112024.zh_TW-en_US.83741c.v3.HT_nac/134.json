    "trans": "These foreign visitors with dual-entry permits take turns succeeding each other, with a new generation replacing the old. People of various shapes and sizes gather together, paying the price for their livelihoods. There's nothing to laugh at; instead, such blatant and meticulous inspections might be a further step towards integration.\nContinuing forward, I finally found Father Hu at the Compassion Hong Kong Canteen managed by Jingbian. In my memory, this place used to be a store selling donated clothes, shoes, and socks. During the pandemic, I passed by and found the inside and outside messy. Moreover, during the peak of the pandemic, I couldn’t stay inside for even a minute before escaping. Outside, I fortunately met a male volunteer, who was wearing a mask while talking. Through our conversation, I learned about the background and intentions of this NGO."
