Please scroll down\n■ Cryotherapy: The treatment is more thorough, but is very painful.\nIf the DIY treatment method does not lead to improvement after a month, or if the corn covers a very large area, it is best to seek medical treatment as soon as possible, or seek medical assistance from the beginning. The most common method in outpatient clinics is cryotherapy, which is more effective than ointment, but the disadvantage is that it is very painful.\nAccording to [redacted_name], cryotherapy uses liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees of low temperature to destroy the corn tissue, causing the corn to gradually dry out and fall off after necrosis. After repeated treatments, the corn will gradually disappear, but there will still be residual keratinized tissue in the deepest parts."
