    "trans": "“Normal.” [redacted_name] let out a breath, not seeming disappointed by his answer. People have their individual preferences, and preferences are subjective. Beside,[redacted_name] didn’t say he disliked it, which was enough.\nShe put her headphones and cell phone back into her coat pocket and continued, \"Actually, I also didn't have much of a reaction the first time I listened to it. However, later on I kept playing it over and over in my room, and I gradually fell in love with it. It's a kind of music that's suitable for listening to leisurely when one is alone. 」"
