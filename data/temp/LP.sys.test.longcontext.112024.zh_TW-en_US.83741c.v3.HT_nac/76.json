    "text": "這句話非常奇怪，聽起來像是會出現在[redacted_name]冥想課當中的哲學解釋，而且也和這件道具真實的功能完全沒有關係，那麼，紅骷髏是怎麼得出這個結論的呢？\n為此，席勒想要拿到那件名為方尖碑的道具，看看它到底有什麼特殊之處。\n[redacted_name]回到神盾局的辦公室當中的時候，他直接打電話叫來了神盾局的老員工[redacted_name]。",
    "trans": "That statement is extremely odd—it sounds like some sort of philosophical explanation you’d hear in one of [redacted_name]’s meditation classes, and it has absolutely nothing to do with the artifact’s real function. So, how did Red Skull arrive at that conclusion?\nBecause of this, Schiller wants to get his hands on the artifact called the Obelisk to see what makes it so special.\nWhen [redacted_name] returns to the S.H.I.E.L.D. office, he immediately calls in a veteran S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, [redacted_name]."
