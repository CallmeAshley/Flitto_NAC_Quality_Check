    "trans": "A report from The Guardian states that a study involving over 80,000 adults in the UK found that standing does not reduce the risk of diseases such as stroke and heart failure. Additionally, standing for more than 2 hours a day may increase the likelihood of conditions such as deep vein thrombosis and varicose veins. The study's results were published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.\nDr. [redacted_name] ([redacted_name]) from the Faculty of Medicine and Health at the University of Sydney stated that those who sit or stand for long periods should incorporate regular exercise into their daily routines. The key point is that standing for too long does not offset the effects of prolonged sitting and may harm the circulatory health of some individuals. Long-term standing does not improve cardiovascular health, but rather increases the risk of circulatory system issues."
