    "trans": "[redacted_name] approached the nest and noticed that [redacted_name], who lay inside, still had tears pooling at the corners of his eyes. Once he realized [redacted_name] was there, the [redacted_name] who had been curled up in bed immediately got up and hugged him.\n“I missed you,” he whispered into [redacted_name]’s ear. The warmth of his breath and the scent coming from the back of his neck were both luring him in. [redacted_name] had only just pulled away, but [redacted_name] drew him back in again. He cupped [redacted_name]’s face and kissed his lips over and over."
