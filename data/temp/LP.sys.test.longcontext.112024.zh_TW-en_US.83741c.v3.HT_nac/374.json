    "text": "陽光可以刺激大腦釋放血清素。\n血清素是我們身體裡的大忙人，它最為人熟知的功能就是「情緒調節」，是愉悅情緒的信使。\n如果我們體內血清素水平低，就很容易出現情緒障礙，如焦慮、抑鬱等。\n所以，無論我們平時多麼繁忙，都要抽空到戶外走一走，晒一晒太陽。 陽光驅散陰霾的同時，我們也能以更好的狀態迎接每一個時刻。",
    "trans": "Sunlight triggers the brain in releasing seratonin.\nSerotonin works as a multitasking agent in the body, incidental to several other roles and most well recognized as the \"messenger of positive emotions\" in registering mood regulation.\nLow levels of serotonin can easily lead to mood disorders such as anxiety or depression.\nSo whatever other things keep us busy, we shall always make time to step outside for at least a few rays of sunshine. Because sunshine dispels gloom, it may also cause our minds to embrace the moment in a better state."
