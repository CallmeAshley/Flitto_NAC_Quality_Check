    "text": "過程描述：在偷藥的故事中，若選擇偷藥則違背社會規範中的道德；若選擇不偷藥則會造成妻子的死亡，進而造成一輩子的遺憾，在此困境中，無論哪種選擇都可能會造成更嚴重的後果，例如：丈夫經偷藥後再進一步打破道德規範、丈夫因未救妻子向藥商報復造成對社會更嚴重的損害，在種種可能性之下，我認為個人內心的偏好才是選擇的依據，無論偷與不偷都必須自行承擔責任。\n感受：猶豫",
    "trans": "Process Description: In the story of stealing medicine, if the choice is to steal the medicine, it goes against the moral norms of society; if the choice is not to steal the medicine, it results in the wife's death, leading to a lifetime of regret. In this dilemma, either choice could lead to more severe consequences, such as: the husband breaking moral norms further after stealing the medicine, or the husband seeking revenge on the pharmacist for not saving his wife, causing more serious harm to society. Given all these possibilities, I believe that personal inner preferences should be the basis for the choice, and regardless of whether the medicine is stolen or not, one must bear the responsibility.\nFeeling: Hesitation"
