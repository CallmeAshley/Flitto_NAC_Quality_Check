    "text": "雖然Super Micro對AI伺服器產業的影響力已經逐漸式微 (GB200量產時程落後鴻海與廣達3–6個月)，但這家公司還是擁有不錯的AI伺服器的設計與製造能力。 從地緣政治角度，如果Super Micro遇到生存挑戰，美國政府應該不會希望看到Super Micro被中國企業收購，或是該公司員工跳槽到中國企業。",
    "trans": "Although Super Micro's influence on the AI server industry has gradually diminished (the GB200 mass production schedule is 3-6 months behind Foxconn and Quanta), the company still possesses strong design and manufacturing capabilities for AI servers. From a geopolitical perspective, if Super Micro faces survival challenges, the U.S. government would likely not want to see Super Micro acquired by Chinese companies or have its employees move to Chinese firms."
