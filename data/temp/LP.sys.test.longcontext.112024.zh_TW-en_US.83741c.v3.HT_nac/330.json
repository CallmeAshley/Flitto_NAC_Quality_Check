My manager is also 'me,' so there's no way I'd get caught. Anyway, I'll head back first and send the evidence of turning [redacted_name] into a doll to Lord Tianjun. Does that work?\"\n\"Yes, the filming schedule at Tianjun isn't finished yet, and the manager will come to violate you later. I'll also send you self-hypnosis audio files for brainwashing purposes. Starting tonight, you must listen to them every day.\""
