    "trans": "When competiting in terms of the supply chain, Taiwan may not necessarily have an advantage.\nMoreover, the location selection of large technology companies also takes into account the environment, water and power construction, infrastructure, tax system, preferential subsidies...\nThe followings are even more depressing to mention:\nAt that time, President Tsai Ing-wen had just taken office.\nThe Taiwan left by President Ma was almost dying:\n• National power was weakening and the stock market was flat\n• We were the dead last among the four Asian tigers\n•The economy was stagnant. People, money and technology were all sucked away by China\n• We lacked water, electricity, money and even people. Anything needed was unavailable."
