    "trans": "[redacted_name] no longer paid attention to them, pushed the door open, and walked into the courtyard, intending to clear her mind.\nAs soon as she pushed the door open, she saw [redacted_name] standing hesitantly at her door. Upon seeing her come out, he was so startled that he took a step back.\n\"What's wrong, Sister Wan? \"\n[redacted_name] lowered his head and stammered, \"I heard... sounds... coming from your room. Was it your maid?\"\nShe initially thought it was [redacted_name] with that mysterious man from last time, but seeing [redacted_name] neatly dressed, it was clear it wasn’t her."
