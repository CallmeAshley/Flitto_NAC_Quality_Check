    "trans": "This characteristic is called \"resonance phenomenon\". What is a wave? For example,\nwhen we throw a stone into the water, on the water surface, waves appear and continue to spread outward.\nThis is a kind of wave. In fact, waves are everywhere.\nLight and sound are also waves. The measurements of wave fluctuations have two standards,\nwhich are frequency (which is the the number of vibrations per second)\nand amplitude (which is the size of the vibration). When the frequency of wavees matches\nwith the inherent resonant frequency of an object,\n\"resonance\" occurs.\nSound wave resonance can produce louder sounds than normal vibrations.\nFor example, in string instruments such as guitars and violins, the strings are placed on a resonance box.\nWhen the strings vibrate, the sound produced by the strings and"
