However, this man looks a bit too sinister, making one feel uneasy.\n[redacted_name] stared at him, examining him up and down, and muttered to himself, \"What made the princess fall for you?\"\n\"Uh, sir, I think you've misunderstood. The princess is only interested in my top scholar abilities, and has no other feelings towards me.\""
