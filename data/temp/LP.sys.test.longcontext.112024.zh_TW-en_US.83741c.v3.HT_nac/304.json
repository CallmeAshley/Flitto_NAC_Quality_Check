His Highness generously gave them three divine approvals. A small mistake like this is not worth sweating over.\nShe has absolutely no expectations for the intelligence of foolish mortals.\nHis Highness Chao isn’t really into indulgent eating... actually, most deities are like that. Offer whatever you like—it’s the thought that counts. These days, people don’t always know all the traditional taboos, and the gods aren’t going to hold it against them.\nThat’s why she’s eaten guavas and tomatoes without raining down punishment. She’s not that petty, okay?"
