The colossal 79-zhang tall [redacted_name] manifestation appeared, dominating the battlefield with an imposing presence.\n\"Boy, show your manifestation! If you want to fight, I’ll gladly accompany you to the end!\"\n\"Manifestation? You’re not worth it. Why don’t you summon that slumbering celestial ancestor of yours instead?\"\nA domain spread out horizontally, and countless violet-gold swords materialized, forming a hundred-zhang-long sword dragon, roaring as it charged toward [redacted_name]’s manifestation.\nA trace of anger flashed in [redacted_name]’s eyes. She was being underestimated—how dare they think divine powers could defeat her manifestation!\nAs [redacted_name] and [redacted_name] continued to go hammer and tongs at each other, out of nowhere, [redacted_name] came rushing toward the almost bereft-of-life [redacted_name] trying to hold her hostage in order for [redacted_name] to give in."
