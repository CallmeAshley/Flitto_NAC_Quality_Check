    "text": "[redacted_name]表示，留學除了是教育工作，亦是產業工作。 有很多地區的留學品牌與香港相若，但她們的推廣效果比香港優勝。 [redacted_name]表示有很多地區，特別是一帶一路國家已對香港有認識基礎，認為香港有吸引力。 首階段將讓相關國家的學生來港就讀，能夠容易打造品牌，事半功倍。 有論指香港生活成本高，李以男士喜歡女士的類型作比喻，指香港雖然面積少，但仍有很多吸引的地方，例如交通便利等，不會擔心其沒有吸引力。",
    "trans": "According to [redacted_name], studying abroad is not only an educational work, but also an industrial work. There are many regions with similar study abroad brands as Hong Kong, but the effects of their promotion are superior than Hong Kong. [redacted_name] said that many regions, especially the countries within the Belt and Road Initiative, already have a basic understanding of Hong Kong and believe that Hong Kong is attractive. In the first phase, students from these countries will be allowed to study in Hong Kong, which will make it easier to build up the brand with half the efforts. Some might say that the cost of living in Hong Kong is high. Lee used the analogy of the type of women that men like, and pointed out that although Hong Kong is small in size, it still has many attractions, such as convenient transportation, so there is no concern about it being unattractive."
