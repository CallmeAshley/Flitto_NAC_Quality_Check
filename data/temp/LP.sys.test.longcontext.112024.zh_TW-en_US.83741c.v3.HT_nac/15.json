    "trans": "The next morning, when [redacted_name] woke up, he found something covering his eyes. He touched it with his hand and found it soft and smooth, likely made of silk.\n\"Don't touch it. That's my sleeve that I just tore down.\" [redacted_name] said calmly, \"It's sunny outside. If we walk out like this, it may worsen your illness.\"\n\"If I really become blind, it doesn't matter whether it is worsened or not...\" [redacted_name] reached to pull down the silk cloth on his eyes. Though [redacted_name] immediately reached to stop him, [redacted_name] still exposed one of his eyes. He saw the bright snow outside the cave, and a pair of grey eyes full of concern."
