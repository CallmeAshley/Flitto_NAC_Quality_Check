Listening to others saying they were going to eat at Haidilao, although someone murmured, \"Why are we eating at Haidilao again?\" they still went together.\nAfter biting the gland, [redacted_name]'s symptoms were somewhat alleviated, at least the pheromones were suppressed. The two of them sat side by side in the private room, with [redacted_name] constantly observing [redacted_name]'s condition. During the sensitive period, [redacted_name] was very emotional. Once, after he talked a little more with someone else, [redacted_name] became jealous and made him comfort them for a long time."
