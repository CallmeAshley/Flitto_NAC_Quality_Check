    "text": "• 使用無矽油洗髮水，徹底清潔頭皮和頭髮，保持頭髮乾淨無油脂。\n• 洗髮後輕輕用毛巾擦乾，不要過度揉搓頭髮，以免頭髮受損。\n2. 分區\n• 將頭髮按區域分好，通常分為頭頂區、兩側區和後腦區，頭頂區是我們增高的重點區域。\n3. 捲杠\n• 從頭頂區開始，將頭髮捲上卷髮杠，選擇適合的卷髮杠尺寸，通常建議使用較小的杠來達到更加緊密和立體的效果。",
    "trans": "• Use a silicone-free shampoo to thoroughly cleanse your scalp and hair, keeping it free of oil.\n• After washing, gently pat your hair dry with a towel instead of rubbing it vigorously, so as not to damage the hair.\n2. Sectioning\n• Divide your hair into sections—typically the crown, both sides, and the back. The crown area is where you’ll focus on adding height.\n3. Using Curlers\n• Starting from the crown, roll your hair onto curlers. Choose a curler size that suits your style; smaller curlers are generally recommended for a tighter, more voluminous look."
