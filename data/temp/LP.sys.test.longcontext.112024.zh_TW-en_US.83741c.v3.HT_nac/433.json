    "text": "當然 moonshot 還很早期，但至少就目前來看，過去一個月 Solana 鏈上 meme 的各種造富神話並沒有出圈的效果，刷信用卡買meme這個功能依舊不慍不火，比起當初 ICO 跟 NFT ，完 全不是一個量級的熱潮\n當然這不妨礙鏈上玩家賺錢，在純場內 PvP 的狀況下，對估值天花板要有個基本的概念，目前沒有上幣安的 meme 估值最高的標的可以參考 $popcat ，大概 1.5 billion 就是極限了",
    "trans": "Of course, the moonshot is still in its early stages, but at least from what we can see now, the various wealth-making myths of Solana chain memes over the past month haven't had an effect on breaking out. The function of buying memes with credit cards is still neither hot nor cold, and compared to the ICO and NFT boom of the past, it's not even on the same level of craze.\nOf course, this doesn’t stop on-chain players from making money. In a purely on-chain PvP situation, it's important to have a basic concept of the valuation ceiling. Currently, for memes not listed on Binance, the highest valuation reference is $popcat, with around 1.5 billion being the limit."
