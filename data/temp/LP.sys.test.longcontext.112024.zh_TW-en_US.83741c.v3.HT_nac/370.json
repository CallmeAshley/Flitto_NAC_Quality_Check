    "trans": "[redacted_name] originally sought peace and quiet, yet no matter how much she circled around, she couldn’t escape the Duke’s household. But now that [redacted_name] was gone, life for the mother and daughter seemed more carefree. Raising the child, reclaiming the dignity once lost to [redacted_name]’s concubine—it seemed like this kind of life wasn’t so bad after all.\nAll of this was thanks to Prince Jin, who had made a promise to the Princess Consort before seeking her out. This was the reason the Princess Consort was willing to expose her vulnerabilities to help him.\nAfter all, she wasn’t just helping Prince Jin; she was saving herself too."
