    "trans": "③ In the worst case, if you really wanted to turn off the music today, you could also communicate with the performers in various ways, such as communicating with the host before going on stage, using the monitor (IEM) during the performance to tell the performers to stop playing, or even simply turning off the performers' monitors as well. If none of these is feasible, then you should not and cannot just cut off the song. Is it so difficult to let him play to the end? 🤦🏻♂️"
