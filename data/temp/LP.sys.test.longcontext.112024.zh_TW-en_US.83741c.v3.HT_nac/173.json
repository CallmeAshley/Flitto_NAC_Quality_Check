    "text": "- 組織架構的調整應該以快速達成公司目標為導向，促進團隊間的協作，同時盡量降低調整前各部門分工合作時可能產生的損耗，提升運作效率。\n- 空降主管在初期應多觀察、多傾聽，少做大幅度的改變，以深入了解團隊現狀和運作模式；中期則專注於建立信任，透過透明的溝通和支持性領導鞏固與團隊的連結；在後期，基於前期的觀察和信任，推動必要的改革，且持 續調整策略，確保團隊朝著共同目標一同前進。",
    "trans": "- The adjustment of the organizational structure should be focused on quickly achieving the company's goals, promoting collaboration between teams, while minimizing the potential losses caused by the divisions of labor and cooperation before the adjustment, and improving operational efficiency.\n- Newly appointed managers should observe and listen more in the initial stage, making few major changes, to deeply understand the team's current situation and operating model; in the mid-stage, the focus should be on building trust, reinforcing the connection with the team through transparent communication and supportive leadership; in the later stage, based on the observations and trust established in the earlier stages, necessary reforms should be implemented, and strategies should be continuously adjusted to ensure the team moves forward towards the common goal."
