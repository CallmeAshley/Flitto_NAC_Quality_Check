    "text": "在冬季和春季，學生還會獲得每個學科領域的進步分數。 在完成兩次或更多次測試後報告進步分數，並顯示與同齡人相比，學生從秋季到冬季或從冬季到春季的進步程度。 例如，如果一個學生的進步得分在第60 個百分位，這意味著他們比60% 的同齡人取得了更多的進步。\n關於低分的解讀。 低分可能表明在技能、知識或挑戰方面存在差距，需要有針對性的支援。 教師或學校管理人員將與家庭討論問題，並就如何解決學生的需求進行規劃。",
    "trans": "In winter and spring semesters, students will also receive progress scores for each subject area. Progress scores are reported after completing two or more tests and show how much progress a student has made from fall to winter or from winter to spring compared to their peers. For example, if a student's progress score is in the 60th percentile, it means they have made more progress than 60% of their peers.\nInterpretation of low scores. Low scores may indicate gaps in skills, knowledge, or challenges that require targeted support. Teachers or school administrators will discuss the issues with families and plan how to address the student's needs."
