Ingenious craftsmen embed both functionality and hidden uses in their works, showcasing breathtaking skill.\nIndeed, only by observing closely can one uncover the decorative details, multiple functions, or craftsmanship of certain exhibits. Some messages can only be deciphered by specific individuals.\nCertain works of art also convey hidden messages and emotions, such as a gilded copper box engraved with 100 aligned footprints, letters, and symbols. Together, these symbols form a puzzle, containing secrets shared among them."
