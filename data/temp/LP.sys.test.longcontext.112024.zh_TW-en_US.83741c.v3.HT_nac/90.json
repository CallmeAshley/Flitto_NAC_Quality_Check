    "trans": "[redacted_name] said, “Not too many! Everyone who helped guard the formation in the imperial city last year is here.”\nBack when they were guarding that formation, [redacted_name] and the others had promised that once it was a success, they would treat everyone to chicken legs—one for each. However, after it ended, they couldn’t find anybody, so that chicken-leg feast never happened. Today, they can finally keep that promise. Bowl after bowl of chicken-leg noodles was served, and Shi Qingxuan said, “All right, everyone—no need to hold back. Dig in!”\nA crowd of beggars squeezed in from the table to the floor, cheering. They each picked up a big bowl and started slurping away. As they ate, someone suddenly said, “Hold on, something’s not right. I sense a demonic presence!”"
