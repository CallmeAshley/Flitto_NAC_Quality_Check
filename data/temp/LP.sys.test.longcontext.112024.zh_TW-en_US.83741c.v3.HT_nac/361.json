    "trans": "❤️Amen! Take suffering as your weapon!\nReading the above scripture, I prayed to the Lord: Lord [redacted_name], You saved me from \"my sins\" by taking death on the cross as the weapon of victory! You defeated death through death! I am not someone who enjoys suffering, but God allowed me to know Him through hardship! Take on the mindset of using suffering as a weapon, separating yourself from sin! Willingly reject human desires and live the remainder of your life according to God’s will on this earth! Amen!\nIn Christ, suffering is a disguised blessing! Amen!"
