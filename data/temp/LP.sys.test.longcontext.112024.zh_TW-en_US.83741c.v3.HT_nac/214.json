    "trans": "I will wait until she finishes learning the basic grammar before proceeding with structure training.\nCurrently, she can answer correctly orally,\nbut her writing lacks good structure.\nThe main issue is that she hasn't written sentences for at least over a month;\nshe says she has written,\nbut I have not seen her assignments.\nThis week's vocabulary review test, she has forgotten most of it.\nThis week's homework is the pink book,\nLesson 13,\nP. 198, 192-193,\nIf there is time, practice P. 187, 189, 195.\nReported above."
