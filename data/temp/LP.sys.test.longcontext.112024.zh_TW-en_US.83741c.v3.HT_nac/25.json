I just want to ask you, did you arrange [redacted_name]?\"\nUpon hearing this, [redacted_name] raised his eyebrows: \"What are you talking about? How could I arrange [redacted_name]? Didn't [redacted_name] just tell you everything? She is the one who arranged it. Did it cause any harm to you? Wuyou, I’m sorry.
