    "trans": "Meanwhile, it also triggered her most unwanted memory, the day of the car accident. [redacted_name] has never forgiven herself to this day. She believes that it was possibly her identity as the boss of the Mafia that caused [redacted_name] to get involved.\nThe truck that caused the major accident has always been considered an accident, but [redacted_name]'s heart does not believe this. Her heart refuses to accept such a simple answer and desperately looks for clues to prove that the car accident was not an accident but a \"murder\" orchestrated by someone."
