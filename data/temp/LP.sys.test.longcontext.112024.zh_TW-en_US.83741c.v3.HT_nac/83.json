    "trans": "[redacted_name] turned his head. He was disappointed by [redacted_name]’s lack of involvement during this period and let out a snort without saying a word.\n[redacted_name] took a deep breath, pinching her palm and silently telling herself, “The movie isn’t finished yet. Just hold on a bit longer.”\nThe pain in her palm brought her back to her senses. “I know you blame me for not helping you. But think about it—neither of us has any experience. Without Xie Kai, we wouldn’t even know how to handle the driver stealing fuel, or the head of the extras pocketing money, or the lunch boxes being cut back. We’d be in over our heads.”"
