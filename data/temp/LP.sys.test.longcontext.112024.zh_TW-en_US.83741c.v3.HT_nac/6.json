    "text": "現在因為您不再害羞了。 因為您知道要享受高潮的美妙了。 更因為您真的很信任我了、很愛我了，所以您自然而然的就會於做愛時親密的跟我互動，讓兩人的性刺激更敏感，讓兩人的性高潮更達巔峰。\n親愛的，我真的很愛您。 後天週日我們做愛的時候，您要更主動的求愛、更淫蕩的呻吟、更色情的尖叫（越大聲越激情）、更猥褻的搖晃性感的乳房與臀部、身體隨著公牛的衝撞而自然的律動喔。",
    "trans": "Now, because you are no longer shy, you know to enjoy the wonder of orgasm, and furthremore, because you truly trust me and love me, you naturally would interact with me intimately during our intercourse, so that we feel more sensitive to sexual arousal and our climax reaches a greater peak.\nMy dear, I truly love you. The day after when we make love on Sunday, you must demand more proactively, moan more seductively, scream more pornographically (the louder the more exciting), shake your sexy breasts and buttocks more obscenely, and let your body sway naturally to the thrusting of the bull."
