    "trans": "■ 《Commentary on the Treatise on Febrile Diseases》 (by Cheng Wuji) - A serious illness recently healed. The blood and vital energy have not yet recovered. The residual heat has not dissipated. A person who, after forcibly balancing Yin and Yang, falls ill, is referred to as Yi. For a man who has just recovered from an illness but is not fully healed, and then engages with a woman, contracting the illness, it is called Yang Yi. For a woman who has just recovered from an illness but is not fully healed, and then engages with a man, contracting the illness, it is called Yin Yi. (Note: The above comes from Chao Yuan.) The interaction of Yin and Yang causes a response, and the remaining toxins contaminate the body. It is like a change of Yi. The person will experience heaviness in the body, shortness of breath, indicating damage to the vital energy. The lower abdomen will feel urgent, with tightness in the Yin, and there will be a cramp-like sensation in the knees and shins, reflecting an extreme condition of Yin. Heat rises and strikes the chest, causing a heavy head and reluctance to lift it. The eyes may see flashes, indicating the influence of toxins, with the Yi energy affected, steaming upwards and dispersing, leading to the scattering of Yin energy."
