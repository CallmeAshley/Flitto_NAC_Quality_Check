    "trans": "One of them was in charge of driving. He was tall and thin. The one sitting in the back seat was the man who pulled the ponytailed girl into the car. This guy was tall, with a scar on his face, and protruding joints in his hands. He is likely a martial arts practitioner.\nThe ponytailed girl kept struggling. Although she had a lot of alcohol and was quite drunk, her mind was still very clear.\nBut the scar-faced man quickly took out ropes and a cloth from the car, tied up her hands and feet, and stuffed her mouth with the cloth, so that she could neither move nor yell."
