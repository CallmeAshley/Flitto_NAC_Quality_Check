    "trans": "The storyline revolves around the complex emotions between father [redacted_name] and son [redacted_name]. [redacted_name] followed his father to learn to make traditional family pastries since he was a child, but whenever it came to the last critical step, [redacted_name] would always order his son out of the door and finish it alone, making [redacted_name] unable to fully grasp the core technique. As time passed, the conflict between father and son deepened, eventually leading to [redacted_name] leaving his hometown to pursue another career. It was not until after his father passed away that [redacted_name] gradually understood his father's good intentions while sorting out his belongings at home, but at this time he could no longer express his gratitude and understanding to his father in person."
