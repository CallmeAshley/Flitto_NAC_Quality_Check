    "text": "她當然是赤裸的。\n嚴格來說她配帶著少得可憐的布料，三個絲質蝴蝶結掛在依理的乳頭和陰蒂，它們都是用鱷魚鉗緊緊咬著皮肉固定著。 蝴蝶結隨風漫舞是如何輕柔，固定的方式卻是何等粗暴。\n日子又往冬天近一步了，天氣反反復復在秋與冬之間舉期不定。 [redacted_name]遲遲未肯給依理一點禦寒衣物，洗澡水也依舊是冷水，就看看[redacted_name]何時才會哀求[redacted_name]允許她穿衣服，用熱水洗澡吧，盛平這樣想。\n少女弓起美妙的曲線，那雙峰好像又大一圈了。\n青春期的發育速度有時真會嚇人一跳。",
    "trans": "She was of course naked.\nStrictly speaking, she was scantily clothed. There were three silk bows hanging on Yili's nipples and clitoris. They were all fastened by crocodile clips tightly on the skin. While the bows were gently waving in the breeze, the way thy were fastened was so rough.\nAs the days gradually approached winter, the weather was hesitating between fall and winter. [redacted_name] still wasn't willing to give Yili some warm clothes, and the bath water was still cold. Let’s just wait and see when [redacted_name] will beg [redacted_name] to let her put on some clothes and take a hot bath, Shengping thought.\nAs the girl curved up her beautiful figure, the breasts seemed to have grown further.\nThe speed of development during puberty can sometimes be really surprising."
