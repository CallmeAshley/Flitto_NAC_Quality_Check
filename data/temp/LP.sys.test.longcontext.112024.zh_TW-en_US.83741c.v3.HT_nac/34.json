    "trans": "[redacted_name] said, \"You said so yourself, that you really want to make fr...fr...friends with His Highness!\"\nHe even deliberately imitated [redacted_name]'s teeth-gnashing stuttering. [redacted_name]'s face turned menacing, and his hand quietly reached for the knife he carried on his back. [redacted_name] then said, \"Fine, now we've talked it over. Anyway, remember that His Royal Highness never thought very badly of you, except for that time when he was angry because you were too excessive. After that, he never said a single bad word about you in front of me! From now on, you should be a normal person, speak normally and express yourself normally. If you act weirdly again, I will scold you. \"\n[redacted_name] lowered his head and stayed quiet initially. Upon hearing the latter part, he rolled his eyes and said, \"Haven't you scolded me for several hundred years?\""
