    "trans": "\"Fourth Brother, how can you say such a thing?\"\n[redacted_name] said, looking aggrieved.\n[redacted_name] sneered, \"Don't you assume that I am not aware of what you have in mind. If you ever dare to target Ranran again, don't blame me for being rough.\"\nAfter that, he pulled [redacted_name] by the hand and took her into his room.\n[redacted_name] felt quite touched, as at least this fake husband of hers knew to protect her.\nDownstairs, acting like a spoiled child, [redacted_name] told [redacted_name] in tears, \"Oh... Auntie, I know you favor me the most. Please assert your authority on my behalf!\"\n[redacted_name] had four sons and no daughter, so she treated [redacted_name] and [redacted_name] like her own daughters. \"What's the matter, my child? Tell me how you were wronged, and I will vent your anger for you.\""
