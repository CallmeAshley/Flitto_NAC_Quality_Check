    "text": "但儘管如此我個人還是支持柏拉圖主義， 在我看來，一切都有預定的結果，很像柏拉圖哲學中的永恆數學物件。 就像我們發現了一直存在的數學真理，等待被揭示。 從這個意義上說，數學不是一項發明，而是一種發現，是一條理解現實更深層次結構的道路。 在柏拉圖主義的支援下，數學的這種永恆和普遍的方面最能引起我的共鳴",
    "trans": "However, despite this, I personally still support Platonism. In my opinion, everything has a predetermined outcome, much like the eternal mathematical objects in Plato's philosophy. It's like we've discovered a persistent mathematical truth just waiting to be revealed. In this sense, mathematics is not an invention but a discovery. It is a path to understanding the deeper structure of reality. It is this timeless and universal aspect of mathematics, underpinned by Platonism, that resonates most with me."
