    "trans": "\"I really want to audit the lectures by Professor Li!\"\nAs [redacted_name] was walking toward the classroom, she overheard some female students in the next deparment discussing Professor Li.\nSince the first day that Professor [redacted_name] came to the Department of Economics, people ranging from the School of Business to the School of Arts had been discussing him. The content is always terms like tall, handsome, young and gentle. Indeed, there were only a handful of young and attractive professors on this university campus. Fortunately, the rule of Seoul National University did not allow students from other departments to audit, otherwise Professor Li's lectures would have been packed.\nAs someone who values appearances, [redacted_name] felt fortunate to have chosen to enter the economics department."
