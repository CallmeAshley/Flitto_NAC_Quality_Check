    "trans": "Why did you suddenly stop reading my messages?\nCan you please not make me someone you hate or dislike?\nIn my messages on LINE, I was very clear\nI won't cling to you, I just want to resolve the conflicts and unhappiness between us\nIt's true, these things keep happening over and over again. Don't say you're so annoyed, I've been reflecting too\nI'm really feeling more and more powerless\nThe longer we drag this out, the harder it is to go back to how things were, because you never give me a chance\nI don't know why you always can't think positively"
