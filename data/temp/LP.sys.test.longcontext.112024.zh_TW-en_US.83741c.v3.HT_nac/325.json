    "trans": "Daoism involves aligning the people with their leaders so they are united in life and death without fear of danger. Heaven refers to the natural forces of yin and yang, the alternation of seasons, and the passage of time. Earth encompasses distances, terrains, sizes of areas, and matters of life and death. The General is characterized by wisdom, trustworthiness, benevolence, courage, and strictness. The Law pertains to organizational structure, official procedures, and the efficient use of resources. These five factors must be acknowledged by all leaders. Those who comprehend them will achieve victory, while those who do not will fail.\nBy assessing these factors, one may determine: Which leader is righteous? Which general is capable? Which environment favors success? Which laws are enforced? Which army is stronger? Which soldiers are better trained? Which rewards and punishments are clear? By evaluating these, one can predict victory or defeat."
