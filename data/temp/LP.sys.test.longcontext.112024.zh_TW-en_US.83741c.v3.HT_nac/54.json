Oh, going to oppa's house?\" How can we go home without achieving today's task, [redacted_name] thought to herself.\n[redacted_name] was confused as he looked at his girlfriend, who was solemn and seemed to be planning something, \"OK.....?\"\nAlong the way, [redacted_name] constantly checked through all the spaces in the car, as if it was her first time riding in [redacted_name]'s car. -- It was to ensure there were no candies.\nAs soon as she got off the car, [redacted_name] uttered that phrase again.\n\"Oppa, trick or treat?\"\n[redacted_name] was stunned, so it’s not over yet? Then he searched his pocket, but no matter how he searched, there was nothing inside. All the candies had been taken away."
