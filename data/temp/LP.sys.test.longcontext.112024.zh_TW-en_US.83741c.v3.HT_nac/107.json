    "trans": "“Let’s wait for word from Tianyi!”\n[redacted_name] nodded, then turned to [redacted_number] with a bit of hesitation. “Princess, I really don’t think this has anything to do with the young master. The enemy must be up to no good…”\n“Enough—I’ll find out the truth.”\n“Yes, Princess.”\n[redacted_name] went back to her guard post, feeling torn. If she didn’t hand over the item, she would feel she was letting the Princess down. But if she did hand it over, she worried it would bring harm to [redacted_name].\n[redacted_name] held the child in one arm and used the other to clasp [redacted_name]’s hand. “Princess, trust Second Brother. If he really intended to harm you, he would’ve done it long ago.”"
