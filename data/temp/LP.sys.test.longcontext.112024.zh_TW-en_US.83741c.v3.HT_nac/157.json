    "trans": "Eh, this body is truly pitiful!\nBut now this body belongs to her [redacted_name], so she must live according to her own rules;\nDeathly Dissipation does sound quite formidable, but it is actually just a type of chronic poison. The poisoned person's physical condition gradually deteriorates, and their resistance weakens. As long as the dosage is controlled and the time is long enough, even a strong person will gradually become weak and ill under its effect, eventually dying from the illness.\nAlthough it's not an extremely potent poison, it's not something that an ordinary doctor could diagnose."
