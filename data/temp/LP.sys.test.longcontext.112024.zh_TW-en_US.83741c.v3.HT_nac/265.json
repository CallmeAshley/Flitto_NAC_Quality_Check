    "trans": "The inhibitors had long been scattered on the carpet. [redacted_name], naked and carefully wrapped in a quilt by [redacted_name], fell sound asleep.

Now that they both smelled of each other, the mere thought of this fact was enough to cause [redacted_name] to have a physiological reaction despite of the willpower he was so proud of. We went too far. He thought to himself, wondering who would be the one falling in the other's hand."
