Percentages are\ncalculated according to the number of patients for whom\ndata are available. Continuous variables are summarized\nusing means (standard deviations, SD) or medians (inter-\nquartile range, IQR) based on the distribution of the data.\nFor the primary composite outcome of alive and RRT-\nfree, we performed a logistic regression analysis with the\noutcome as the dependent variable with treatment group\n(thiamine or placebo) and RCT as independent variables.\nAll binary outcomes were analyzed similarly. Results are\ndescribed as an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) with a 95%\nconfidence interval (CI). A post hoc sensitivity analysis\nadditionally included baseline SOFA score to adjust for\nillness severity.\nFor the continuous outcomes of serum creatinine level\nand serum lactate level, we constructed linear mixed\nmodels to account for the longitudinal nature of the data.\nWe compared repeated measures of the laboratory values\nat each time point (0 h [baseline value], 24 h, 48 h, 72 h)",
