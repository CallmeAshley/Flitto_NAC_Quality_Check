    "text": "Mia goes to Benny's place where she finds him lost in thought, sorting through photos. He tells her that if she's hungry there's food in the kitchen and drinks at the bar but he's kind of busy and they should talk later.\nMia says that she's in trouble and he puts the photos away and asks what happened. She describes the whole situation with Angel Mora. Benny thinks her story is amazing, almost unbelievably so. He doesn't think that she's lying but thinks that she is likely confused because her imagination is too vivid due to her job as a journalist. He thinks that if Mora is angry at her, he must have lost his marbles. Heinvites her tolive with him until things quiet down. He would keep her presence a secret and says she would be safe there.\nHe tells her that if things drag on, he can buy her a house in the Maldives. He tells her to please understand but he can't get involved in this matters because he needs to remain neutral with both the werewolves and vampires, and she should probably stop annoying the world's most powerful vampires.\nMia tells Benny that it was not her fault it came to this. Benny says that if she needs help he can help her leave, change her name, her age, whatever she needs. The offer stands. He can also open her a bank account with a six-figure balance so she can buy a house and have a peaceful life. But if she wants to play around with ancient prophecies and put herself into further danger she can, but she should not bother him with it because he does not have time for it. He then explains, pointing at the pictures, that he's planning a bigconcert and his fans expect a lot of him and he cannot fail them and apologises.\nMia can then - Ask what he's doing exactly - or - Leave - (both free options). If she asks him for details he explains he is choosing outfits, decorations and special effects;if she just leaves, the scene skips directly to the next choice.\nMia says that she needs to go and you get a choice (both free options)to tell Benny- Don't worry, I understand [üíó+1 Benny] - or We're through [ -1 Benny].\nIf Mia choses the first answer, Benny says that a girl like her is a rare find and asks her to call him, to which she replies that of course she will.\nIf Mia choses the second answer, she tells him that everything is more important than her. He doesn't look up from his photos, says it's one less problem for him, snaps his fingers towards the door and says the exit is there. She storms away and waits for his apology call, which never comes.",
