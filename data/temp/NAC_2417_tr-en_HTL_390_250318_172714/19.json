Ona olan özlemimi ekranda görerek giderecektim . Bir zamanlar o özlemi ona sarılarak gideriyordum🥺. Her neyse program başladı. İbrahim selim Merti çağırırken şöyle dedi . \" Annelerin maşallahı genç kızların inşallahı Mert ramazan demirrr \" diye bağırmıştı. Bende dışımdan kendime dedim ki \" Genç kizlar boşuna sevinmesin onun başı bağlı yengeniz var yengeniz o da benim \" dedim ancak bağlı değil bağlıydı olacaktı. Şuan hala Mertle sevgili oluyor olabilirdik . Tabii o salaklığı yapmasaydım. 🤦♀️🤦♀️\n1 hafta önce (YAPTIĞIM SALAKLIK)\nMertle konusmak bana iyi gelmişti. Evet aklınıza gelen gibi birsey yaşamadık Mert ile o olay olan öpüşmeden sonra Mert beni eve bırakmıştı. Hersey normaldi ancak telefonuma bilinmeyen bir numaradan mesaj gelmişti. Mesaj şuydu;\n- Merihi kimin öldürdüğünü biliyorum\nAynen böyle bir mesaj gelmişti. Tabu ki endiselenmistim . Merih benim en yakın kız arkadaşımdı. Ancak birkaç yıl önce onu öldürmüşlerdi ancak polislerin bunun bir kaza olduğunu söyleyerek olayın üstünü kapatmışlardı. Ben buna inanmayıp 1 yıl boyunca olayın peşinde kosusturmustum ama bir sonuca varamayınca vazgeçmiştim.\nAma bu mesaja inanmıştım. Ve mesaj yazmıştım.\n- Öldüren kişi kim ? diye sordum . Bakalım karşılığında ne isteyecekti . Kesin para derken evet para istemişti. 10.000 tl istemişti. Bende maalesef salak gibi inanıp göndermiştim. Adam ise şunu dedi .",
    "trans": "from Afra\nOne week later\nFrom what I heard, Mert had postponed his Mugla vacation. Ibrahim Selim had invited him to his show, and I was waiting in front of the screen to watch him. I was going to soothe my longing for him by seeing him on screen. There was a time when I used to ease that longing by hugging him. 🥺 Anyway, the show started. When Ibrahim Selim called Mert, he shouted, \"Mothers' blessings, young girls' hopes, Mert Ramazan Demirrr!\" I told myself loudly, \"Young girls shouldn't get their hopes up, he is engaged. And girlies, I am your sister-in-law, yep, that's me.\" But I actually should’ve said “he was engaged” not “he is engaged”. Right now, Mert and I could still be together. Of course, if I hadn't made that stupid mistake. 🤦♀️🤦♀️\nOne week ago (THE STUPID MISTAKE I MADE)\nTalking to Mert had been good for me. Yes, just like you might imagine, nothing happened between us after that incident, after the kiss. Mert had dropped me off at home. Everything seemed normal, but then I received a message from an unknown number. The message was:\n-\"I know who killed Merih.\"\nThat's exactly what the message said. Of course, I was worried. Merih was my closest friend. A few years ago, she had been murdered, but the police had covered it up, claiming it was an accident. I didn't believe them and had spent a year chasing the case, but since I couldn’t find anything, I finally gave up.\nBut I believed this message. So, I wrote back:\n-\"Who killed her?\" I wanted to see what they would ask in return. I was sure they were going to ask for money, and sure enough, they did. They asked for 10,000 TRY. Unfortunately, I stupidly believed them and sent it. The person then said:"
