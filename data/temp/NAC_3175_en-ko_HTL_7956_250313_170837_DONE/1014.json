    "text": "Team, Good afternoon 😊\nToday, I walked all rooms on 9th Floor and cleanliness has improved a lot, THANK YOU SO MUCH for all your effort. However, I also noticed some areas for improvement that are just as important as the cleanliness and should be addressed: Room Presentation in general.\nWe will discuss this in detail on Sunday October 6TH, in Brian Office at 9:30 to 10:30 AM during a supervisors meeting. The purpose of this meeting is to provide feedback, identify points to improvement, share techniques that might work for you, and other related topics. This has been a wonderful year, full of challenges and opportunities, and I want us to finish the las three months of the year successfully 😊😊😊\nThank you so much!!!!!",
    "trans": "팀원 여러분, 좋은 오후입니다😊\n오늘, 저는 9층의 모든 방들을 돌아다녔으며 청결도가 많이 개선되었음을 볼 수 있었습니다. 모두의 노고에 감사드립니다. 하지만, 청결도만큼 중요한 개선이 필요한 몇 가지 구역이 있음을 발견하여 말씀 드립니다: 프리젠테이션 룸 전반적으로.\n이에 대한 상세한 내용은 10월 6일 일요일에 브라이언 사무실에서 오전 9시 30분에서 10시 30분까지 관리자 미팅할 때 다루도록 하겠습니다. 이 미팅의 목적은 피드백을 제공하고, 개선할 점을 확인하고, 여러분들에게 효과 있을 만한 기술들 및 그 밖의 다른 주제들을 공유하는 것입니다. 올해는 도전과 기회로 가득찬 멋진 한 해였습니다. 올해의 나머지 3개월도 성공적으로 끝내봅시다😊😊😊\n감사합니다!!!!!"
