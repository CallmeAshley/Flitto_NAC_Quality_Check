Lesson\nseven will review this style of writing again through the examination of two famous examples\nof this argumentative style: President Obama’s DNC speech given in 2008 and President\nReagan’s RNC speech given in 1980.\nR OGERIAN A RGUMENTATIVE REVIEW\nRemember that the Rogerian strategy of argumentation does not seek to win a\ndebate but instead seeks to prove a claim through an understanding of the other side and a\ndiscussion of shared values. In other words, with the Rogerian style of argumentation, a\nwriter must first make a claim about an issue. Then, in order to prove this claim, that writer\nneeds to demonstrate a clear understanding of the other side of this issue and find the\ncommon ground between both sides. This common ground is used to prove the writer’s\nclaim. This strategy encourages the audience to be more open to the argument being made\nbecause the writer has demonstrated respect for other arguments about an issue.\nROGERIAN SAMPLE A RGUMENT – P RESIDENT OBAMA’S DNC\nA CCEPTANCE SPEECH, 2008\nOur first stop in this week’s lesson is to review a Rogerian sample argument,\nPresident Obama’s DNC Acceptance Speech in 2008. Please click on the following link to\nlisten to the acceptance speech: The American Promise. You may also read the acceptance\nspeech given by President Obama below at the end of this lesson. This discussion will not\n175\nfocus on the topics that Obama presents in his speech, but the way in which Obama\norganizes his speech. When you listen to or read this speech, note that there is an argument\nthat President Obama makes – he wants to prove to the audience that he is the best\ncandidate. However, to do this, he needs to ensure that the other side, made up of\nRepublican voters, is not alienated by his discussion. Therefore, his acceptance speech\ncannot be confrontational. Instead, he must attempt to prove his side by considering the\nviews of Republicans and Independents and showing the common ground.\nLet’s take a look at the speech in further detail. First, the purpose of Obama’s speech\nis not only to accept the democratic nomination for president, but also to convince voters to\nvote for him. However, President Obama not only wants to convince Democrats to vote for\nhim, he also seeks Republican votes. Therefore, when he opens his speech, he does not\n‘attack’ the views of the Republicans. Instead, he opens with a dream that holds true for all\nAmericans: “It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work\nand sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one\nAmerican family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.” Then,\ninstead of insulting the Republican candidate, John McCain, he praises him: “Now let there\nbe no doubt. The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country\nwith bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.” In this way,\nObama keeps the views of his audience in mind. Remember from lesson six that the\nRogerian strategy appeals to the audience by showing the benefits of the opposing side. The\naudience would not be swayed to vote for Obama if he insults their beliefs or their\ncandidate.\nIn the body of the speech, Obama begins to give the meat to his side, the reasons in\nsupport of his argument. He first lists some of the issues that American faced in 2008. Then,\n176\nhe explains how his policies differ from McCain’s. In this section, he carefully avoids\ninsulting McCain. Instead, Obama shows how McCain is mistaken. However, he does so in a\nmanner that unifies all Americans, no matter what their political affiliation is: “Tonight, I say\nto the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great\nland - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the\nAmerican promise alive.” As illustrated in Obama’s speech, in a Rogerian essay, it is\nimportant to keep the audience in mind throughout the argument, even when presenting\nyour particular argument.\nLesson six mentioned that at the end of a Rogerian essay, the common ground and\nhigher interest benefiting both sides should be emphasized. President Obama does this at\nthe closing of his speech:\n[L]et us agree that patriotism has no party. I love this country, and so do you,\nand so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be\nDemocrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and\nbled together and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not\nserved a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of\nAmerica. [...]\nWe may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the\nnumber of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The reality of gun ownership may\nbe different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in\nCleveland, but don’t tell me we can’t uphold the Second Amendment while keeping\nAK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex\nmarriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters\ndeserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of\n177\ndiscrimination. Passions fly on immigration, but I don’t know anyone who benefits\nwhen a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American\nwages by hiring illegal workers. This too is part of America’s promise - the promise of\na democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in\ncommon effort.\nIn this section, Obama attempts to bridge the gap and establish the common ground\nbetween Republicans and Democrats. He shows that all Americans want the best for the\nUnited States, and he also attempts to show the common ground between a number of\nethical issues. This section of the speech illustrates what is meant by common ground.\nROGERIAN SAMPLE A RGUMENT – P RESIDENT REAGAN’ S RNC\nA CCEPTANCE SPEECH, 1980\nOf course, Barrack Obama was not the only president who made use of the Rogerian\nstyle of argumentation. Ronald Reagan did the same with his Republican National\nConvention speech in 1980. Please click here to listen to this speech, which starts at about\n3:15 into the video: President Reagan’s RNC Acceptance Speech. You can also find his\nspeech at the end of this lesson as well. Like the section above that discussed Obama’s\nacceptance speech, this section emphasizes the organization of Reagan’s speech, not the\nparticular topics within his speech. In this speech, Reagan’s goal is similar to Obama’s 2008\nspeech: he too wants to win the votes of Americans. To do this, Reagan utilizes the Rogerian\nformat.\nFirst, Reagan begins his speech by removing the barriers between Republicans and\nDemocrats. He states this directly at the beginning of his speech:\n178\nI want my candidacy to unify our country, to renew the American spirit and sense of\npurpose. I want to carry our message to every American, regardless of party\naffiliation, who is a member of this community of shared values.\nIn this quotation, Reagan does not polarize his audience. He is keeping his audience in\nmind, and he lets his audience know that his speech and candidacy is for all Americans, not\njust for one political group. In the introduction, he also tells his audience that all Americans\nshare the same concerns:\nNever before in our history have Americans been called upon to face three grave\nthreats to our very existence, any one of which could destroy us. We face a\ndisintegrating economy, a weakened defense and an energy policy based on the\nsharing of scarcity.\nThis quotation from Reagan shows that all Americans, no matter what their political\naffiliation is, share the same concerns. Rogerian arguments do not start by honing in on the\nargument and antagonizing the other side. Instead, like the example above from Reagan’s\nspeech, Rogerian arguments should appeal to both sides of an issue.\nIn the body of his speech, Reagan continues his argument in a calm, rational\nmanner. Reagan shows the flaws with the other candidate; however, he avoids insulting the\nother side, and instead, Reagan explains why his beliefs are stronger than the other\ncandidate. He does this through specific points that illustrate unity between Americans:\n“Together, let us make this a new beginning. Let us make a commitment to care for the\nneedy; to teach our children the values and the virtues handed down to us by our families; to\nhave the courage to defend those values and the willingness to sacrifice for them.” Reagan\nalso unifies Americans in his speech with the following: “It’s time to put America back to\nwork, to make our cities and towns resound with the confident voices of men and women of\n179\nall races, nationalities and faiths bringing home to their families a paycheck they can cash\nfor honest money.” Reagan does this in his speech because he wants the other side to vote\nfor him, so he attempts to create a tone of unity, not division.\nFinally, at the end of his argument, President Reagan shows the common ground\nbetween all American voters:\nIt is impossible to capture in words the splendor of this vast continent which\nGod has granted as our portion of His creation. There are no words to express the\nextraordinary strength and character of this breed of people we call Americans.\nEverywhere we’ve met thousands of Democrats, Independents and\nRepublicans from all economic conditions, walks of life bound together in that\ncommunity of shared values of family, work, neighborhood, peace and freedom. They\nare concerned, yes, they’re not frightened. They’re disturbed, but not dismayed. They\nare the kind of men and women Tom Paine had in mind when he wrote, during the\ndarkest days of the American Revolution, “We have it in our power to begin the world\nover again.”\nIn Reagan’s final",
