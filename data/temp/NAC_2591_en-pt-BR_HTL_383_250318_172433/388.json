    "text": "The makeup artist who had worked on him that morning truly did an incredible job. Even this close, Ivan can’t see a hint of the marks he had left on Luka’s throat, and something about it itches in the back of his brain. Ivan’s gaze flits to Luka’s bare arms and he wonders, if he were to shift his grip to Luka’s wrist, to his forearm, would the briefest of pressures bruise him as easily as his neck and thighs?\nBefore Ivan can pull him down or speak, Luka is the one letting go of his hand to brace his palm against Ivan’s shoulder as he leans down.\n“You were looking, today.”\nSomething about Luka’s words give Ivan pause. His voice is as carefully neutral as it usually is, and the statement is only that: a statement of fact.\n“So what?” Ivan asks as he settles his hands on Luka’s waist. “Did it bother Hyuna, or something?” He still doesn’t know what Luka’s relationship is with her, exactly. He had thought it was something like his own with Till, but lately, he’s suspected that he misread things.\n“No,” Luka says after a moment. “Just curious.”",
