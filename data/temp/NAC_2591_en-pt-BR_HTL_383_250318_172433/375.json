They punish drivers on their score card for things out of their control. They don't account for some stops taking longer than others, Amazon contacts our DSP dispatch, wondering what is going on when this happens. Also, Amazon needs to fix their damn lockers when we call support and neither of us can get it to work. There is 1 locker that never works, everyone now just skips it without even stopping because it never works and never gets fixed.\nNumber 3 I'm not sure if this is just my DSP or not, but they DO NOT pay attention when assigning vans to routes. I should not be getting a step van route while in a Uhaul branded Ford transit. I should not be trying to cram everything into a small van while the longer van next to me has only 6 bags and 8 overflow. Assign vans to routes based on the size of the van and the cubic feet of the cargo.",
