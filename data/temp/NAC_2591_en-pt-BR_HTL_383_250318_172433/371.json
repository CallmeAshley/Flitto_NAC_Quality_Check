    "text": "While research-driven, R&D-intensive companies like Novo Nordisk and IBM have engaged with deep tech for years, other sectors have held back. Our engagement with executives from low R&D intensity sec- tors suggests that deep-tech ventures come with risk profiles and growth trajectories that are very different from these leadersâ€™ usual venture activities. Corporations in finance, retail, government services, and health care have plenty of experience with startup ventures, but most involve digital innovations. Others, such as those in con- struction and infrastructure, have had, until recently, only limited engagement with external startups.\nIf these organizations wish to harness deep tech, they must explore new strate- gies and practices. Our work with com- panies in sectors as diverse as fashion, transportation, and banking has yielded insights that can help guide managers in low-R&D organizations into the uncharted territory of deep tech.",
